Website interaction/comments for static sites is hard. You've already jumped the huge hurdle to get Webmentions up and running :clap: and it's a shame that the default choice for Webmentions is "social media platform" of choice rather than utilising our websites to interact with each other. The big disconnect that I've experienced is in setting up my website to automatically notify another website that I've replied to them in a note. 

I've spent the afternoon getting this ready, and I'll manually send your website the notification. If it appears, then my experiment worked :)
