I'm a strong supporter of personal websites, and in my opinion, the first step before diving into your design or choosing hosting is securing your own domain name. It's the key to ensuring the lasting presence of your website, regardless of where it's hosted.

Prioritising your domain sets the foundation for longevity, giving you control and ownership over your online space. 

Plus, as Jim discusses in this post, your domain can be your digital verification badge, adding an extra layer of authenticity to your online presence. 

Let's empower personal expression on the web‚Äîgrab that domain and set the stage for a lasting digital presence! üåê‚ú®
