One of the many cool things about being [InternetNZ member](https://internetnz.nz/membership/) is the chance to participate in surveys that help guide and shape the direction of the Internet in Aotearoa.

Sometimes as part of particiapating in these surveys they will send something out to members. 

The latest gift was this hat. It features the [InternetNZ logo](https://internetnz.nz) embroided on the front and an embroided .nz and smaller InternetNZ logo on the back.
