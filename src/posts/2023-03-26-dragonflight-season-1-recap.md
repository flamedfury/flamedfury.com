My World of Warcraft guild [<Ascent>](https://raider.io/guilds/us/amanthul/Ascent) completed our last raid for Dragonflight Season One tonight. 

I enjoyed this season. Dragonflight has been a more enjoyable expansion than Shadowlands was. 

My highlights of Dragonflight Season 1 were:

Raids

- Ahead of the Curve: Raszageth the Storm-Eater

We cleared Vault of the Incarnates on heroic difficulty in five weeks. We took 32 pulls to kill the last boss, Raszergeth. Overall we had 22 boss kills on normal, 52 on heroic and 4 on mythic difficulty.

Dungeons

- Dragonflight Keystone Master: Season One

I ran 25 dungeons to achieve a Mytic+ score of 2,017.3. My highest timed key was a 19 Court of Stars on fortified. My lowest timed key was Temple of the Jade Serpent on fortified.

I completed most of my run this season with guild members rather than pick up groups. This has made the entire achievement much more enjoyable than in previous seasons.

I'm looking forward to taking a break from Warcraft and raiding until Season Two begins.
