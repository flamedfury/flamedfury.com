Today I've added a [/uses](/uses/) page to the [About](/about/) section. A [/uses](/uses/) page is a recent Web trend where webmasters detail their setups, gear, software and configs. Check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for hundreds of /uses pages across the Web.

While working on my [/uses](/uses/) page, I took the time to refresh my [About](/about/) page. I hadn't made an update to it since 2021.
