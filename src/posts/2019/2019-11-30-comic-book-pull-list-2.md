House of X / Powers of X have wrapped up Jonathan Hickman's reboot of the X-Men franchise and set the story seeds for the next 30 years. 

November sees the launch of many new X-Men titles and continuation of the main X-Men book (X-Men DX) and Marauders and Excalibur.

A lot is going story-wise, and I can't wait to catch up when they hit the digital shelves on Marvel Unlimited.

Anyway, here's what I collected this month.
