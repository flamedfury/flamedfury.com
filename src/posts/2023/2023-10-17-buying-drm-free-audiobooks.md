So, you're into audiobooks. Good call. How do you even buy a DRM-free audiobook?

[Libro.fm](https://libro.fm) is my new go-to because every book there is happily free from a DRM headache. Nice, right? Plus, your purchase throws support to a local bookstore. Double win.

But what about when you're dying to read a book, like "[Extremely Online](https://bookshop.org/p/books/extremely-online-the-untold-story-of-fame-influence-and-power-on-the-internet-taylor-lorenz/19718842)" by [Taylor Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz) that your library doesn't have, and bam! Regional restrictions slam the door in your face. Lame.

So, what do you do when you hit this roadblock? I found myself in this exact mess, chasing an audiobook about the wild world of the Internet. Here's the lowdown on how to sidestep the annoyances:

- Fire up your VPN and pretend you're in the U.S.
- Get cozy with Libro.fm and create an account.
- Sign up for the monthly membership—two credits for you.
- Pick any random bookstore to support. They all deserve the support.
- Use those credits to grab "Extremely Online" and another book that your local library missed. Thanks, credits!
- Download your DRM-free audio files. No chains here.
- Upload those sweet DRM-free audio files onto your Audio Bookshelf server.
- Say bye to your Libro.fm membership and cancel until next time.
- Get back to living life. Easy.

That's it. Nine steps to audiobook freedom. Also, shoutout to Libro.fm for being cool and a not-so-friendly “sup?” to those annoying publisher restrictions. Who needs borders on stories, anyway?
