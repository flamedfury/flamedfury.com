Hello web surfers, and welcome to February's recap. This month I spent time updating existing pages and added some new pages.

Over on the [Explore](/explore/) section, check out the new [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) page. The purpose of the Explore section is Web discovery. Like the previous pages, I added to the area, the [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) played a large part in early Web discovery. 

I wrote some words to give an overview of what a [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) is, why they were valuable to both webmasters and web surfers, how they fell out of use and how they are now making a comeback. Every website should have a blogroll. I'll add links soon. Sorting through thousands of bookmarks is hard, especially when metadata across the web is messy! It's a big job and is in its early stages of development.

I've added a [/uses](/uses/) page to the [About](/about/) section. A [/uses](/uses/) page is a recent Web trend where webmasters detail their setups, gear, software and configs. Check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for hundreds of /uses pages across the web.

While working on my [/uses](/uses/) page, I took the time to refresh my [About](/about/) page. The last time I made an update to it was in 2021. 

I spent some hours updating my [Mixtapes](/recordshelf/mixtapes/) page to fit the new website design. Like the [Vinyl Collection](/recordshelf/vinyl/), I'm still considering where this page should live long-term. I've taken the time to add some extra mixtapes and a description of what they are. If you give them a listen, [let me know what you think](/contact/).

Finally, you will have noticed the new website design; I love it and hope you do too. You can read more about it in the post I shared last week; [Weclome to Flamed Fury 2023](/posts/weclome-to-flamed-fury-2023/).
