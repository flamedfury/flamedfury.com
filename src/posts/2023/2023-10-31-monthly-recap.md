Hello web surfers, and welcome to October's recap. 

I wrote three posts:
- [Hear me out: The Whopper is the best type of burger](/posts/hear-me-out-the-whopper-is-the-best-type-of-burger/), where I dissect the Whopper.
- [DRM-Free Audiobooks](/posts/drm-free-audiobooks//), where I try to listen to a newly purchased audiobook.
- [Buying DRM-Free Audiobooks](/posts/buying-drm-free-audiobooks/), where I try to buy DRM-free audiobooks.
- [On Blogs and Digital Gardens](/posts/on-blogs-and-digital-gardens/), where I weigh in on a conversation online.

I added a **single** vinyl to the collection over on the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/) page:
- Mac Miller [Tiny Desk Concert](/recordshelf/#npr-music-tiny-desk-concert). An amazing recording.

For website maintenance I removed the about page and merged the words into the [homepage](/). Re-reading the home page now, fifteen days later I'm not sure that I like it and am going to change it up again soon.

Thanks to the Amazing [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/) I've revamped my [tags](/tags/) page based on her new [tags demo](https://eleventy-excellent-tags.netlify.app/tags/). I was happy with my previous implementation based on 11ty's [Zero Maintenance Tag Pages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/), but Lene's is so much cooler.

That concludes everything for this month. We'll catch up again soon.
