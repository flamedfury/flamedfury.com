I've been tracking the beers I drink in [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) since 2013. Like many companies, Untappd also produce an end of year look back that I thought would be fun to share here on my own website.

My top rated beer was [Descent to the Dungeon of Dankness](https://untappd.com/b/garage-project-descent-to-the-dungeon-of-dankness/5488496) by [Garage Project](https://garageproject.co.nz/). This was the first beer I tried at [Beervana 2023](/posts/beervana-2023/) and I loved it. A big bitter tasting West Coast IPA. Garage Project released this one in cans for a couple months after Beervana so I was able to enjoy a few more times.

My top 5 rated beers were:
- [Descent to the Dungeon of Dankness](https://untappd.com/b/garage-project-descent-to-the-dungeon-of-dankness/5488496): [Garage Project](https://garageproject.co.nz/)
- [Hop Zombie](https://untappd.com/b/epic-brewing-company-hop-zombie/47923): [Epic Brewing Company](https://epicbeer.com/)
- [Knife Party Party](https://untappd.com/b/liberty-brewing-knife-party-party/5490098): [Liberty Brewing](https://www.libertybrewing.co.nz/)
- [Springwood](https://untappd.com/b/pacific-coast-brewery-springwood/5468807): [Pacific Coast Brewery](https://pacificcoastbeverages.co.nz/)
- [Fresh Hop Bitter Bitch](https://untappd.com/b/parrotdog-fresh-hop-bitterbitch-ipa/3739106): [Parrotdog](https://parrotdog.co.nz/)

I rarely check in a beer twice, it depends. I checked in **117 beers in 2023**, 4 less than in 2022 where I checked in **121 beers**.

Friday was my top day to check-in a beer with **41 check-ins**, followed by Saturday with **36** and Sunday with **17**. This makes sense as I very rarely drink during the week.

My average rating was **3.39**.

The first beer I checked in this year was [San Chico](https://untappd.com/b/8-wired-san-chico/5064337) by [8 Wired](https://8wired.co.nz/).

You earn badges when checking in beers. I earned **111 different badges** with the top 5 badges were:
- **Verified Adventure**: Level 100
- **For the Can**: Level 82
- **Brewery Pioneer**: Level 62
- **Riding Steady**: Level 62
- **Pale as the Moon**: Level 58

I tried **23 different styles** of beer in 2023, 3 more than the **20 in 2022**. The style I checked in the most was **IPA - American**.

I drank beer from **39 unique breweries**. My top 5 breweries were:
- **Garage Project**: 38
- **Baylands Brewery**: 21
- **Behemoth Brewing Company**: 8
- **Parrotdog**: 5
- **8 Wired**: 3

This makes sense as I purchase beer from Garage Project monthly and Baylands is my local.

It was a good year for beer, I managed to try some amazing fresh Hazies, while avoiding the over saturation of the style and got to try a lot of great West Coast and standard IPAs. 

I'm looking forward to more West Coasts in 2024.
