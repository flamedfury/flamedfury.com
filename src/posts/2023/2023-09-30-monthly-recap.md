Hello web surfers, and welcome to September's recap. 

I wrote three posts:
- [Bushwalks](/posts/bushwalks/), where I  
- [The Secrets of Azeroth](/posts/the-secrets-of-azeroth/), where I 
- [2023 Winter](/posts/2023-winter/), my seasonal post for the winter just been.

I collected two new vinyls, but haven't uploaded them yet. I'll get onto that. This raises a good question about the metadata, should the date recored be the day I purchased the record, recieve the record, or added it to the collection on my website? If you have any thoughts send me an [email](mailto:flamed@flamedfury.com).

Back to the IndieWeb. Last month I mentioned I was strugling to get [WebMentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) going. This month I managed to get them working, specifically the `mention-of` type. 

I also manmaged to get a first iteration of website [replies](https://indieweb.org/reply) set up. Check out the [first reply](/notes/2023-09-27-1/) to a blog post by [Lost Letters](https://lostletters.neocities.org/).

I revamped the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) page. These should all be marked up per the [IndieWeb specs](https://indieweb.org/bookmark) and you can also subscribe to my new [bookmarks feed](/bookmarks-feed.xml).

That concludes everything for this month. We'll catch up again soon.
