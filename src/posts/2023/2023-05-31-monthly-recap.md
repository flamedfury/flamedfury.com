Hello web surfers, and welcome to May's recap.

I wrote two new posts; they both look into audiobooks, where I get my audiobooks and how audiobooks have changed my listening habits. [Where Do You Get Your Audiobooks?](/posts/where-do-you-get-your-audiobooks/) and [How Have Your Listening Habits Changed?](/posts/how-have-your-listening-habits-changed/).

I cleared my backlog of new music and added thirteen new records to the vinyl collection on the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/). 

- [III - Temples of Boom](/recordshelf/#iii-temples-of-boom)
- [Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)](/recordshelf/#enter-the-wu-tang-(36-chambers))
- [Wu-Tang Forever](/recordshelf/#wu-tang-forever)
- [Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...](/recordshelf/#only-built-4-cuban-linx...)
- [Endless Summer Vacation](/recordshelf/#endless-summer-vacation) (four versions!)
- [Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version](/recordshelf/#return-to-the-36-chambers:-the-dirty-version)
- [oops!...I did it again](/recordshelf/#oops!...i-did-it-again)
- [Britney](/recordshelf/#britney)
- [In The Zone](/recordshelf/#in-the-zone)
- [How Come / American Psycho](/recordshelf/#how-come-american-psycho)
- [M.A.D / Lyrics Of My Life](/recordshelf/#m.a.d-lyrics-of-my-life)

I retrofitted the old shelf pages into their own posts. I liked what I wrote on each subject but didn't feel the words fit where I wanted to take the shelf pages. The Recordshelf became [The music and me](/posts/the-music-and-me/), the Bookshelf became [Books and me](/posts/books-and-me/), the Gameshelf became [Video games and me](/posts/video-games-and-me/), and the Comic Rack became [Comics and me](/posts/comics-and-me/). Moving these short essays to their own posts pages has allowed me to revamp the [Collections](/collections/) page. I'm more excited to develop this section with new dynamic and automated content.

Finally, I spent an afternoon catching up with the upstream changes to [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/commits/main).
