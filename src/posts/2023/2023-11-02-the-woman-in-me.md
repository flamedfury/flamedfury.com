I finished reading Britney Spears book [The Woman in Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_Me_(memoir)) last week. The [audiobook version](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781761107641) is read by Michelle Williams (remember Dawson's Creek?).

I enjoyed it and think it was a good read whether or not you are a fan of hers or not. 

It was interesting going through her timeline and remembering events from her career that were all over the news and gossip sites as they happened and hearing her commentary. 

The Justin Timberlake stuff was interesting, some bombs in there that I wasn't aware of (read the book to find out), and this wild recap of when Britney and Justin bumped into Ginuwine in New York:

> "One day, Justin and I were in New York, going to parts of town that  I'd never been to before, Walking our way was a guy wearing a huge blinged-out medallion. He was  flanked by two giant security guards. Justin got all excited and said  so loud, 'Oh yeah. Fo' shizz. Fo' shizz. Ginuwine what’s up homie?’"

The way Michelle Williams read it was hilarious!

Diving into the [conservatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_case) was crazy. I understood that her dad was involved, but didn't realise that her mother and sister were also down with it. I understand that this was "legal" and all, but I can't believe that they were allowed to pull this shit on Britney. Legal or not, her family are horrible people.

The poor girl has been through hell, I'm glad it's over and hope that she can carry on doing what she wants to do away from the public.
