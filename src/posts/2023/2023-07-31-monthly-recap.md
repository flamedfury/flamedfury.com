Hello web surfers, and welcome to July's recap. I can't believe that it's already August!

I wrote four posts:
- [Now page update: poster art for shows and movies](/posts/now-page-update-poster-art-for-shows-and-movies/) where I explain how I combined used two APIs to list my recently watched TV shows and movies along with cover art to go with it.
- [Marvel Unlimited Continue Reading](/posts/marvel-unlimited-continue-reading/) where I share a few thoughts on the Marvel Unlimited apps "continue reading" function and how it is both great and terrible at the same time.
- [Now Page: Automatically Syncing My Now Pages](/posts/now-page-automatically-syncing-my-now-pages/) where during the [32bit.cafe's](https://32bit.cafe/) first code jam I took the time to sync my [now page](/now/) with my [omg.lol now page](https://flamed.omg.lol/now).
- [My InternetNZ Hat](/posts/my-internetnz-hat/) was a simple post where I shared a couple pictures of a hat I recieved from being a member of [InternetNZ](https://internetnz.nz/). 

I added new links to the [Links](/explore/links/) page. They are websites I visit for [Comics](/explore/links/#comics), [World of Warcraft](/explore/links/#world-of-warcraft) and [Diablo](/explore/links/#diablo).

Two new vinyls were added to the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/) collection; Taylor's Version of [Speak Now](/recordshelf/#speak-now-(taylor's-version)/) and Blink182's [Enema Of The State](/recordshelf/#enema-of-the-state), another classic to add to the collection.
