Last night (2023-06-22), my World of Warcraft guild [Ascent](https://raider.io/guilds/us/amanthul/Ascent) killed [Scalecommander Sarkareth](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=205319/scalecommander-sarkareth), the last boss required to complete the [Ahead of the Curve: Scalecommander Sarkareth](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=18253/ahead-of-the-curve-scalecommander-sarkareth) achievement. This season, we cleared the raid on heroic difficulty within 6 weeks of release. Overall, it was a decent raid, made even more enjoyable by an excellent raid team.

I also completed [Dragonflight Keystone Master: Season Two](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=17844/dragonflight-keystone-master-season-two#). I finished with an overall Mythic+ Score of 2,097.

I also managed to complete enough Mythic+ runs at 16 or higher to get enough [Aspect's Shadowflame Crests](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204194/aspects-shadowflame-crest) to recraft my [Bow of the Dragon Hunters](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193449/bow-of-the-dragon-hunters) at item level 447 and upgrade another couple of pieces to 441.

When I went to recraft my bow, I was nervous as I didn't have enough skill points to guarantee a rank-five craft.

However, as I was so close, it guaranteed me a proc, and I was successful with my rank-five recraft.

The only downside to this is that I managed to craft the bow right before our Scalecommander Sarkareth fight. It would have been helpful to have this earlier in the season. This would have required me to have completed enough Mythic+ 16 keys very early, maybe next season...

Overall an enjoyable season. We will clear the raid again a couple more times to get the kill and achievement for members who could not make the raid last night. 

As usual, once that's done, I am looking forward to a break from World of Warcraft before Season Three begins.
