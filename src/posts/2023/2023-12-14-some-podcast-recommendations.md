In my previous post, [My Podcast Rotation: Keeping It at Four](/posts/my-podcast-rotation-keeping-it-at-four/), I asked for podcast recommendations, and surprisingly, I received a few suggestions worth sharing.

My wife has been diving into parenting podcasts and got me to check out [Good Inside with Dr. Becky](https://www.goodinside.com/podcast/), so I'm planning to listen to a few episodes soon.

[Andrew](https://canion.blog/) reached out to recommend [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/), a podcast I recently tuned into for [Episode 097: Duel of the Defaults!](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) during the [Default Apps](/posts/app-defaults/) craze last month. I caught up with their most recent episode, [099: AaaS! (Adam as a service)](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/099), featuring [Adam](https://adam.omg.lol/) from [OMG.LOL](https://omg.lol/). I'll keep this one in my rotation.

Then, [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/) dropped a list of recommendations on me! [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/), and [Land of the Giants](https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast). I listened to This American Life years ago, so I'll explore recent episodes that look interesting. Similarly, I binged on the first season of Serial during its initial buzz; I'm not sure if I'll dive into any more. As for Land of the Giants, it's a new one for me, and I'm excited to catch up on stories about the tech companies I'm less familiar with.

I'm still keen for more recommendations! Feel free to [email](/contact/) me or leave a comment with your blog—let's keep the conversation about great podcasts going!

**Update 02/01/2024** Several weeks ago, I got another recommendation from [José Muñoz](josemunozmatos.com). I'm only catching up now while I have some downtime. His top four podcasts are:
- [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected)
- [The Best One Yet](https://tboypod.com/)
- [Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)
- [Design Details](https://designdetails.fm/)

I've yet to have a chance to dive into any of these, but I will be sure to give the latest episodes a go when I get going with yard work when I get back home. José also has a fantastic website; be sure to check it out!
