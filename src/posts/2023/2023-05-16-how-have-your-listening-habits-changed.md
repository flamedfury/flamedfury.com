I've read [38 books so far in 2023](/bookshelf/). 

I've managed to read this many books in 5 months due to switching to audiobooks as the primary way that I [read books](/posts/where-do-you-get-your-audiobooks/).

Lately, I've stopped listening to some podcasts that no longer entertain me. I listen to less music while walking the dogs, driving alone, or doing household chores. 

On Fridays, I enjoy listening to my release radar playlist on Spotify during my dog walk, and I usually listen to music more often on weekends. However, when I'm with my family, I prefer to play music since they wouldn't want to hear me read a book in bits and pieces. 

I always prioritize listening to new podcasts as soon as they come out. 

Otherwise, I spend most of my time listening to audiobooks. Have you transitioned to audiobooks yet?
