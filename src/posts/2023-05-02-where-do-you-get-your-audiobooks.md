This post is a response to [Katy's](https://katydecorah.com/) recent blog post where she asks, "[Where do you get your audiobooks?](https://katydecorah.com/notes/audiobook-sources/)"?

Like Katy, I read the majority of my books in audiobook format. 

## Local libraries
I'm lucky to have access to two libraries in my region. The Lower North Island libraries offer [ePukapuka](https://epukapuka.overdrive.com/), which is powered by [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) and accessed through [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby). Wellington City Libraries offer [Ä«Whare Pukapuka](https://www.wcl.govt.nz/downloads/), which is also powered by [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) and accessed through [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) and [Borrow Box](https://www.borrowbox.com/) as well as host of other online tools for accessing different types of media including magazines and newspapers. 

Audiobooks have changed the way I read books. Your local library is the way to go if you're into it. 

When an audio version isn't available, I can still borrow an ebook and sync it directly to my Kobo! 

## Apple Books
If the library fails me, I head to [Apple Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/). Using Apple Books is out of simplicity as it's a native app on my phone. They tend to be expensive, but for the odd book, now and then, it's okay.

## Kobo
Finally, if all else fails, I can head to the [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/nz/en/audiobooks/plans) store, where I have an account ready to go. 

## Libro.fm
I've looked at [Libro.fm](https://libro.fm/) but have yet to use them. The bookstores that the service support aren't local to me. I still like the idea, though. 

In the meantime, I'm watching [Booksellers](https://www.booksellers.co.nz/) to see if they are rolling out something similar locally.
