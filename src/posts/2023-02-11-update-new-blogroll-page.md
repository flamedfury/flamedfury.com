Today I've added a [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) page to the [Explore](/explore/) section. The purpose of the Explore section is Web discovery. Like the previous pages that I have added to the area, the [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) played a large part in early Web discovery. 
I wrote some words to give an overview of what a [Blogroll](/explore/blogroll) is, why they were valuable to both webmasters and web surfers, how they fell out of use and how they are now making a comeback. 
Every website should have a blogroll. 

Future plans: The top priority is to organise my Interesting Weblogs bookmark folder into categories and add a brief description of what I like about each personal website I link to. It's a big job and is in its early stages of development.
