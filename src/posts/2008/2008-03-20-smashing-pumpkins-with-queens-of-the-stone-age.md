I believe the [Smashing Pumpkins](http://web.archive.org/web/20080413075801/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/) were last in Aotearoa about ten years ago. This time they’re bringing [Queens of the Stone Age with them](http://web.archive.org/web/20080413075801/http://www.qotsa.com/).

I got into the Pumpkins a bit when they released Mellon Collie, but who didn’t love Bullet with Butterfly Wings or Zer0? Picked up their new album ZEITGEIST last year when they released, was fairly decent, a few songs I enjoy - so was keen to pick up a ticket when the concert was announced.

I never did get into QOTSA much, the only song I knew by them was No One Knows, and only today found out that the drums were too extreme in this track that they had to get the legendary [Dave Grohl](http://web.archive.org/web/20080413075801/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl) to fill in for them.

Sadly I don’t think they’ll have Dave with them tonight playing drums for one track :(

Concert starts in a couple of hours, will let you know how it goes once I recover.
