This photo was taken 25 January on Peter’s boat out in the Wellington Harbour.  We were out for a few hours in the last bit of the afternoon. It had been a lovely day all day, but started getting a bit windy [typical Wellington] and the fishing was a bit dodge.

 We managed a lot of bites and a couple of pulls, the biggest shown in the photo, by yours truely. Unfortunately it was still 5cms under size and had to go back in the drink.

Next time, always next time ;)
