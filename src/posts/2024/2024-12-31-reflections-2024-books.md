What's going on, Internet? As 2024 comes to a wrap I want to reflect on my years journey in reading books. This year I spent most of my time listening to audiobooks again with a couple ebooks read on my Kobo while travelling. I read less books during 2024 than 2023, I'm not mad at this but most likely due to more driving with the kids and family, listening to more podcasts, and generally less time at home by myself doing chores.

I had a good mix of fiction and nonfiction this year. For the nonfiction books I leaned into autobiographies or pop cultural books rather than business/economic books that I may have listened to for a work purpose in previous years.

The highlights this year were books written by local authors. Like my music, I'm a big fan of local media and seek it out whenever I can. Check these out in the recomendations below.

Here's a breakdown of my reading year:

- During 2024 I read **59** books in 2024, **down 31%** from **86** books in 2023.
- I had an average time of **11.6 days** [^1] to read (or listen) to a book.
- In August, I read **8** books, and then in September, I read only **1** book. [^2]
- My reading was diverse: **30** fiction, **14** nonfiction, and **7** romance. [^3]
- Of the 59 books I read, **5** of them were written by [Cheri Baker](https://cheribaker.com/), and **4** by [Tate James](https://www.tatejamesauthor.com/). [^4]

Out of all these books there are a few that I want to share with you and maybe you’ll check them out…

[^1]: Which I suspect might be due to an error in my start/finish logging of a book or two.
[^2]: I managed to smash a few books while on holiday with the family in August, and in September I went back to work after four months of parental leave, and the big book I was reading during September (Exodus) I ended up finishing on the 1st of October!
[^3]: I feel we could get better insights if the metadata for genre was tidied up.
[^4]: The Maddison Kate novels were bonkers, but enjoyable.
