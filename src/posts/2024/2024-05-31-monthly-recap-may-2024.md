What's going on Internet? May has come and gone and with it the end of [Weblog Posting Month 2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) (WeblogPoMo). I managed to post each of the 31 days in May and stuck to the "media" them I set at the start of the month.

Weblog Posting Month allowed me to dial back from my recent posting about the web in general and share short, silly thoughts about the media I was enjoying either during the month or from the past. I explored [TV shows](/tags/tv/), [Movies](/tags/movies/), [Music](/tags/music/), [Comics](/tags/comics/), and a bit of [Gaming](/tags/gaming/).

I can't say that the month was easy. It was a struggle some evenings to sit down and write a post. I'm grateful for chatting with people like [Chris](https://chrisburnell.com/) to get us through it each night.

I'm glad I did it, I'm not going to do anything like it for a while and am going to enjoy my evenings without any self impossed pressure to post anything.

For June, I'm looking forward to working on behind the scenes stuff on the website and some time to participate in [
32bit.cafe Community Code Jam #4: Destination Vacation](https://tilde.32bit.cafe/~ribose/events/destination/index.html). I've got a great idea that I've had on the back burner for a while now and this might be the perfect (only?) opportunity I get to see it through.

Let me know if you're keen to join the Code Jam and join us over on the [forums](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/)

## Website

The big thing this month was the rollout of the new [homepage](/) layout along with the sweeet new header graphics. This was something I always had planned with the 2023 refresh but never eventuated due to failing to get help with the graphics. I found [Abi](https://fizzyrph.tumblr.com/) who was able to help me out and created the awesome header image that graces the front page.

For everything else, I've started a [Changelog](/changelog/) to keep track of the changes, check it out if you want.

## Around the web

[Robb's](https://rknight.me) back again with another funtastic idea, [Slash Pages](https://slashpages.net/). A fun mini site with the details of a selection of pages that are popular across small web websites. To get amongst it I created my own [Slashes](/slashes/) page to keep track and link to all the slash pages I'm working on.

Right, that's it for now. Catch you on the flip side 🤙
