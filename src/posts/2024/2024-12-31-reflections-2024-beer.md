What's going on, Internet? I came into 2024 with a taste for West Coast IPA's (WCIPA) as a continuation of 2023. My love for the WCIPA stemmed from disillusionment of the Hazy craze that has captivated the beer industry for the past half decade.

Ramping up at [Beervana 2023](typora://app/posts/beervana-2023/) I actively sought out WCIPA's and shunned Hazy's [^1].  This trend continued into 2024 where I continued to hunt down WCIPA's whenever I was able to pick up new tins of beer to try. I didn't make it to Beervana 2024 as my family and I were in Fiji enjoying time away while it was on.

Somewhere down the line, I picked up on the new Bright IPA style that had started making the rounds, and the [Thunderbird Bright IPA](https://untappd.com/b/parrotdog-thunderbird-bright-ipa/5740517) from Parrotdog quickly became my fridge filler beer.

Throughout the year I continued to pick up WCIPA's but also explored the new Bright IPA's that were being released and also fell back into the often forgotten New Zealand IPA. The NZIPA is simply an IPA that showcases New Zealand grown hops, and shares the bright finish of the WCIPA. You can see why my eyes opened at this, I found the NZIPA a lot nicer to drink than the heavier WCIPA.

Back to the Bright IPA. I don't feel like there's too much difference between this and an NZIPA. The style is described as clear, filtered and bright, e.g. the opposite to a hazy. The colour can be anywhere from pale to deep gold. The Bright IPA has a lower bitterness than a WCIPA or an American IPA, and it usually favours American hops.

After my end of year heavy drinking session during the December break, during which I tried many new beers, I am a big fan of the Bright IPA. It's lighter than a WCIPA, and I don't get bloated if I have more than two‚Äìthree cans. The ABV is generally lower at around 5.8% versus a typical 6.5-7.5% that you'd find in a typical WCIPA.

While I actively avoid hazy beer, I still tried many of them throughout the year thanks to my FRESH subscription through Garage Project. They make a new fresh and unfiltered IPA every month using different hops and yeasts. The beers are always well made, but I'm finding myself enjoying them less and less, so I might put my FOMO aside and focus more on the bright and clear beers.

As January rolls around, I'll chill out and look at the year with fresh eyes. More IPAs that are bright, clear, and tasty.

I still use [Untapped](https://untappd.com/) to keep track of my beers. Here are my 2024 numbers.

Cheers üçª

I checked in **105 unique beers** across **16 different styles**, with the **American IPA** my top style.

I checked in beers **New Zealand**, **Australia**, and **Fiji**, the three countries I spent time in this year.

I checked in beers across **16 venues** with my most visited being **Baylands Brewery**, **Martinborough Brewery**, **Abandoned Brewery**, and **Brewtown**. Brewtown was for the only beer festival I attended this year.

[^1]: Due to the popularity of hazy beer, the shelves at supermarkets and liquor stores are oversubscribed with the style, and I'm not a big fan of it. This means you might be buying a six-pack or a single tin that has been sitting on the shelf for six to nine months. This can ruin what could have been a great beer.
[^2]: An old favourite of mine so when I heard Epic was [going into liquidation](https://hoppiness.co.nz/epic-brewing-in-liquidation) (six months later, lol) I found a tin to enjoy. They were later saved and are still brewing beer. I don't actively seek out Epic beers anymore
