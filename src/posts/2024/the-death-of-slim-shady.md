# The Death Of Slim Shady

What's up, Internet? I really wanted to post this two weeks after the album's release, but life happens, and here it is. This isn't an album review. It isn't necessarily about the album itself, though I definitely will comment on it. It is about moments you had when you were younger that you may not have appreciated at the time but have since forgotten about.

Music is so personal now, as is the access, the range, and the personalisation of your listening experience. (Being forced to hear the same twenty songs that the DSPs push on you aside). When I was growing up and at school, a handful of radio stations played a handful of songs (similar to those same twenty songs the DSPs push down your throats now). Everyone you knew was listening to the same music (obviously with exception) most of the time.

Every weekend at parties, you'd all be listening to the popular songs, hearing them in every car that drove past, pumping on the stereo as you got ready. Music is so varied these days, right?

Since [Houdini](/posts/houdini/) dropped, my personal hype for the album grew with each passing day. By the time [Tobey](/posts/tobey) dropped, I was bouncing with excitement, messaging [Robb](https://rknight.me/) every time new information dropped on a new single, video, or movement of the actual album release date.

When the much-awaited release day (July 12, 2024) finally arrived, I was buzzing with excitement. My anticipation was through the roof. Was the album dropping at 4 pm or 5 am the next day? The suspense was killing me.

The album dropped at 4 pm, just as I was getting ready to meet my friends at the local brewery. I had it pumping on my AirPods as soon as the album went live on the DSPs. By the time I reached the pub, I was at the end of track eight, Antichrist. Holly crap, was that Bizzare? Yes, it was, and he went off.

After the brewery, we returned to my place to continue the evening. The album was the soundtrack of our car ride home, with Bizzare's verse being the highlight for me and one of my mates, who were big into D12 when we were younger. I was in awe of track nine, Fuel. The shared excitement and enjoyment made the experience even more memorable.

A couple more cheeky beers and three back-to-back listens of the album, and we were done for the night.

The entire experience was super fun. Sitting down and listening to the album multiple times with someone else who was equally excited about it? I hadn't had an experience like this for years. When I think about it, when 50 Cent dropped [Get Rich Or Die Trying'](https://musicthread.app/link/2nJEpSKdmtnTIA59O5FRs9hek4H) in 2003, would have been the last time? Around my eighteenth birthday, we were chilling around my mate's front porch with a box of beers. Yeah, good times.

I started writing this post at the end of July but never finished it. It was hard to get the words out of my head amongst the full-time parenting and eventual return to work. Three months later, with several music videos and bonus tracks released, a trimmed-down version of the album has found a place in my regular rotation.

Songs like Temporary and Somebody Save Me are great, but I don't need to listen to them every time I want to hear the rest of the album. I've also dropped Road Rage because I don't vibe with it, Tobey because I listened too much during the release hype countdown, and the Guess Who's Back skit while adding Fuel (Shady Edition) to the end.

I listened to the bonus tracks, Like My Shit and Kyrie & Luka, but I don't think they fit the vibe of the rest of the album at all, so I most likely won't listen to them all that much. This is what my redone album looks like:

What I'm left with are thirteen tracks and two skits running for a total of fifty-one minutes. Starting with Renaissance, all the way through to Guilty Conscience 2, tells the story of Slim Shady's death and finishes with some humble bragging at the end with Head Honcho, Bad One, and the fire of Fuel (Shady edition) that label mates Boogie and Grip bring along with a new Eminem verse (and more Puff Daddy disses).

Ever since hearing Evil, I can't get that hook out of my head to this day...

> Evil, I'm so evil
> Rotten to the core, a fuckin' twisted cerebral
> I'm so evil, so evil
> It's obvious that I am not like other people
> 'Cause I'm evil, I'm so evil
> Rotten to the core, a fuckin' twisted cerebral
> I'm so evil, so evil
> It's obvious that I am not like other people

So yeah, this has been my favourite Eminem project since Relapse in 2009 and overall best music experience in a long time.

Laters.
