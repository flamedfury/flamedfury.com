What's happening, Internet? [Jedda](https://jeddacp.com) posted the other day about [the millenial generation being huge on nostalgia](https://notes.jeddacp.com/my-millennial-memories/), I'm all about certain types of nostalgia and I love being a millenail so I had to jump onboard this one. Even growing up in opposite sides of the world I see similar experiences and smiled at her memories. I'll follow her format and throw in a touch of Aotearoa flavour.

## Fashion

- Wallet chains on velcro wallets, luckily this didn't make it past primary school.
- DAX wax spiked hair, that shit was impossible to wash out.
- Aluminum ball chain necklaces, went well with white World Industry singlets.
- DVS skate shoes, never school shoes.

## Music & Media

- Movies at the theatre when they still an intermission halfway through.
- Waiting for RTR Countdown to come on to record music videos to VHS on the weekend in the early nineties.
- Channel 4 started in the late nineties, syndicating shows from MTV and Comedy Central, this was huge.
- Making sure to be home at 7pm to listen to Channel Z's Top 20 countdown in the late nineties, early two thousands.
- Figuring out DC++ on IRC to download music before abandoning it for Napster.
- New Zealand Music! This was huge in the late nineties, early two thousands thanks to generous government funding.

## Toys & Games

- Riding bikes, everywhere.
- Transformers, Ninja Turtles, GI Joes, everything had a cartoon tied to it. (I don't think this has changed).
- [Chatter rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatter_ring), these things were insane and drove the teachers at school mad.
- Alex Kidd on the Sega Master System, this was more popular than Nintendo here.
- Pokemon on the Gameboy, Red and Blue, battling with link cables.
- [Jonah Lomu Rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Lomu_Rugby) on the Playstation, no bunts.
- Basketball cards, X-Men cards, rugby league cards. If it was collectible, I was collecting it.

## Tech

- 28.8k external modems that sat next to the computer, internal 56.6k modems came later.
- $20 for 20 hours of dialup internet before ISPs started offering unlimited hours. We also got an extra phoneline by this point.
- As well as IRC, [Instant Messaging](/posts/instant-messaging/) was my jam too, and I'm [still doing it](/posts/instant-messaging-on-xmpp/)!
- By highschool the Nokia 5110 was the phone to have, a local subsidary telco launched unlimited txting in our city and that was that for six months.

## Lifestyle

- Being friends with all the kids in the neighbourhood.
- Paper run as your first job, paid nothing though.
- By highschool if we didn't go away for the Christmas holidays we'd spend our days down the river.
- Getting our full licences by 16 and driving turbo charged cars. Seriously, wtf right?
- Learning to navigate relationships with each other, tragic love stories every other week...

I really enjoyed putting this post together. I might come back to it and flesh it out more later. Like Jedda asked, can you relate? Let us know.
