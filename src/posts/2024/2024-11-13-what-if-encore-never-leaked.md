What's up, Internet? This conversation came up randomly in the [32-Bit Cafe's](https://32bit.cafe/) team chat earlier this month and I had fun with my contribution to the conversation. I then saw the <a href="https://weblogpomo.club/challenges">WeblogPoMo AMA</a> challenge pop up on Mastodon with the same theme and figured I could get in on the challenge with this cheeky response. As per usual, here it is weeks later ðŸ¤£

This is a reply to Tyler Sticka's post, {% inReplyTo "https://tylersticka.com/journal/if-i-could-change-one-thing/", "If I could change one thingâ€¦" %} where they answered <a href="https://alexandra.omg.lol/">Alexandra's</a> question "If you could go back in time and change one thing, what would it be?".
{% endasidePaired %}

If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would head back to Eminem's house in 2004 and stop the friend of his younger brother Nate [^1] lifting a CD-R containing the first eight finished tracks destined for 2004's album Encore. I'd prevent them from leaking, a leak that led to Eminem replacing those tracks with hastily written and recorded the goofy ass songs that wound up on the album.

This change, caused by the leak, ensured that the world never actually saw Encore for what it should have been and cemented his legendary status with a legendary four album run starting with The Slim Shady LP back in 1999. [^2]

The leak, however, cast a shadow on his legacy, a regrettable stain on an otherwise impeccable career up to this point.

As we reflect on the album 20 years later (this week), I just can't help but wonder, what might have been...

There's not too much detail about what the original album was going to look like but we know that the leaked songs that wound up on the bootleg album, [Straight From The Lap EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_from_the_Lab) containted seven or eight songs that were supposed to be on Encore. [^3]

We do know that the album was originally mean to open with the track "We As Americans", leading into "Bully" [^4] and then the rest is left up to interpretation. Here's what I've managed to piece together from years of forum and reddit posts on the topic:

The track originally titled Come On In was later renamed 6 In The Morning and used on D12's second Album D12 World and might have been the original D12 feature rather than One Shot Two Shot that ended up making the album. It's then super unclear whether the tracks Can-I-Bitch, Hallie's Revenge (Doe Rae Me), were going to be included on the album. If they were then encore was going to be diss heavy which also makes me think of the sequencing for the track Toy Soldiers where Eminem reflects on the recent beefs with Ja Rule and Benzino and effectively declares the shady camp as the winners and the beef being over. Bully to Toy Soldiers fits though...

The other interesting thing about Encore was there was a track titled Christopher Reeves that was scrapped shortly after Christopher Reeve's death that same year. We recently had this confirmed on The Death Of Slim Shady album, and if you cruise back far enough on The Way Back Machine you can actually see it on the track list before the relase. (I'll upload a screenshot later)

With the 20th anniversiary come and gone without a mention from official sources, all hope for an original album release to celebrate has been dashed. Oh well, we can always wonder what if though, right?

[^1]: I don't think this was ever cofirmed, but seems to be popular discourse across the web.
[^2]: Encore would've been a much different album. "We as Americans," "Love You More," a lot of songs ended up on the bonus disc because they leaked and that disappointed me." If that would've been on Encore and the other couple songs that leaked, to me it would've been right there with The Eminem Show as far as its caliber. - Read More: [Eminem Interview - His Career, Addiction Battle, More - XXL](https://www.xxlmag.com/eminem-interview-career-addiction/)
[^3]: "I was just coming off The Eminem Show and the 8 Mile soundtrack and I started recording and had about seven or eight songs that were very much in the vein of what I do." - Read More: [Eminem Interview - His Career, Addiction Battle, More - XXL](https://www.xxlmag.com/eminem-interview-career-addiction/)
[^4]: "We as Americans" was going to start the album, then "Bully." "Evil Deeds" was in there. - Read More: [Eminem Interview - His Career, Addiction Battle, More - XXL](https://www.xxlmag.com/eminem-interview-career-addiction/)
