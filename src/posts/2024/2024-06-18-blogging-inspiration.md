What's happening Internet? I was having a quick scroll through [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@flamed/) and saw a post from [Robert Birming](https://birming.com/) asking "[What inspires your blogging?](https://birming.com/what-inspires-blogging/)"

When it comes to writing, I often find myself diving into [things](/tags/thoughts/) going on in [life](/tags/life/) or media that I've enjoyed, as seen recently during [WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/).

One of my favourite sources of inspiration is by engaging with other bloggers' posts, especially those related to the [web](/tags/web/) or blogging, like this one.

Otherwise, I want to share how I did something, usually about how I built Flamed Fury using [Eleventy](https://flamedfury.com/tags/eleventy/).

Writing and reading this post makes me want to go back and tidy up my post tagging...

So waht about you? What inspires your blogging?
