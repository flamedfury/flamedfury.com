What's going on, Internet? Back in May during [WeblogPoMo2024](/tags//tags/weblogpomo2024/) I wrote a post about [shows I want to watch](/posts/shows-i-want-to-watch-2024/) and the very last show on that list was [Twisted Metal](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/133748-twisted-metal).

Well I gave it a go, blasted through it across three evenings and damn, what a dumb fun TV show. The soundtrack is banging, much to do with the "end of the world" happening in 2002 and so all the music up until then was music that they knew 20 years later!

Cast wise, lots of familiar faces. The guy that lost to Eminem in 8 Mile, the tough cop from Broklyn 99, and I always enjoy seeing Neve Campbell.

One interesting thing I noticed during the final episode, was where Falcon's  character, John was having some flashbacks while talking to Neve Campbell, one flashback was recieving the Cypress Hill's fifth studio album, Skull & Bones as a Christmas present. [The same album](/posts/nostalgia-music/) I wrote about back in May when I first thought about watching this show in the first place. Woah.
