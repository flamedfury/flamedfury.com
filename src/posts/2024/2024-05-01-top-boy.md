I actually don't recall how I came across Top Boy, but I'm pretty sure it was from an issue of the [Rec Room](https://thespinoff.co.nz/tags/rec-room) newsletter... Searching through my inbox, it definitely was.

Top Boy is a British crime drama that follows the lives of two drug dealers, Dushane and Sully and their crew in the Summerhouse estate in London. 

The show originally aired between 2011 and 2013 for two seasons of four episodes each before being cancelled? Netflix picked it up again in 2019 and ran for three more seasons until 2023.

Luckily, I got to watch it in one over a month without the long waits across years between seasons.

I enjoyed the show, but the characters and their actions annoyed me to no end. Dushane and Sully are both psychopaths.

If you've not seen it, and you've enjoyed shows like The Wire, [BMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMF_(TV_series)), [Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(TV_series)), and its [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Book_II:_Ghost) [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Book_III:_Raising_Kanan)-[offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Book_IV:_Force), then you'll definitely enjoy this too.
