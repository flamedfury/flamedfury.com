I'm a parent. We have two kids under four years old. I'd say this has been the toughest year of being a parent so far. Life is a constant dance of chaos and love.

There is never a moment of downtime as either of the kids needs your attention at any one time.

Mr Three has started independent play, but not longer than five minutes of time before he needs our attention for one thing or another. We have a large collection of magnetic tiles, I absolutely love watching him create spectacular structures out of them and can't help diving in to help him build crazy, super tall towers.

Miss One is full of curiosity. The moment you set her down, she's off exploring this or that. Our house is her adventure playground. It's remarkable how much she's progressed in her first year.

Weekends are no longer our own. We plan our weekends around the kids activities and keeping them entertained. Visits to the park, music class, play dates, swimming. Just don't fall asleep in the car on the way home!

This year, Mr Three has progressed so well with swimming lessons, this has been a proud parenting moment for us, especially after he was stalling at the start of the year. We think it was boredom, and getting him bumped up to the next class was the best thing that happened there.

Personal time? What is that? Household chores are squeezed into windows of opportunity, usually when one of us is distracting the kids, so the other can get something done.

Bedtimes are crazy. Between me and my wife, we're juggling both kids between us. Bath time, pyjama time, brushing teeth, reading books. On a good night, they're both asleep. We never look forward to when Mr Three can't sleep, poor kid.

By the time that's all done we prioritise getting the dishes done, then entertain the idea of laundry (which seems like a 24/7 activity at our place) before collapsing on the couch, falling asleep while watching the television.

We love them both so much. Being a parent and raising these beautiful kids has been such a wonderful change to our lives.
