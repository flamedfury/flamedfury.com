What's happening Internet? It's day 17 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/), and I've had a hell of a day with the kids, so this isn't going to be anything amazing.

As a [devoted X-Men fan](/comics/), my collection spans from Uncanny X-Men issues 200-300, X-Factor 1-101, to a myriad of randoms across the decades. I've also amassed a substantial collection of the latest Krakoan run, not every series, but most of them. 

I told myself that once the current run was finished, I'd stop collecting individual issues again and start picking up the collections or trades of the stories I particularly liked.

The end of the current era is drawing to a close, and my local comic book store has pre-orders for the new [X-Men books](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/x-men-summer-2024-titles-creative-teams). Should I subscribe or just hold off for the trades for the stories I enjoyed? I'm going to read them all on Marvel Unlimited anyway... 

Collector remorse, right? Do I need to stop being a collector?
