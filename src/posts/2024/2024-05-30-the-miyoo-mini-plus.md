Whats going on Internet. Here's a quick review of the Miyoo Mini+ for day 30 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/)

I picked up a Miyoo Mini+ for myself after seeing [Joel](https://joelchrono.xyz/) talk about, and link to other people talking about it a couple weeks ago. It arrived within a week which was a surprise as packages from Ali Express can take up to a month to make their way down here.

The device itself is gorgeous and well put together. I love holding it and looking at the screen. I've been playing Game Boy Advanced games and I couldn't help but notice how beautiful everything looks on the screen.

After being encouraged by Joel I installed [Onion OS](https://onionui.github.io/) on the device. The process was straight forward and easy to follow the instructions from their website. Before doing this I replaced the stock SD card that is reported to be unreliable with a 64 GB Sandisk Ultra Micro SD card. This has provided me with more than enough storage for the new OS and more space for games that I'll ever be able to play.

It takes 11 seconds from powering on to see the OS loading screen and then 4 seconds to load into the game I was last playing. That's 15 seconds from powered off to playing Pokemon!

It takes 14 seconds to boot up and get me to the game selection menu.

When loading a GBA game, it takes 3 seconds to see the loading screen and a further 3 seconds until the game splash screens and then I'm starting a new game, around 10 seconds total. Similar timings for loading the PSX game, [Thrasher Skate & Destroy](https://www.giantbomb.com/thrasher-presents-skate-and-destroy/3030-18624/).

One of the cool features that Onion OS offers is the ability to quickly switch between games. It keeps a save state of where you are in each open game and you can easily switch between them without doing full reloads.

The SD card that came with the Miyoo Mini was full of games. As I replaced the SD card I replaced them with the [Tiny Best Set: GO!](https://archive.org/details/tiny-best-set-go). They include the required BIOS files required for each of the emulators to ensure the best compatibility. 

There are more games here than I will ever have capacity to play. It will be fun to go through them and have a little go on them.

Overall I'm happy with this device. It can easily fit in my pocket and will be hand to have when out and about and I find myself with a spare moment.
