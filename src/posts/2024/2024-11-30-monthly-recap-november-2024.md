What's going on, Internet? We're now in my favourite month of the year. Move over November because December's here! Not that November wasn't enjoyable, it just felt like I had no time to myself, or at home.

The month kicked off pretty standard with our usual routine before I headed off to Sydney for a week for work. I always enjoy getting to head to the office to spend the time with my immediate and wider team. I got back home in time to attend a work related conference before diving into the usual weekend of family activities.

After just a couple of days of work, it was back to the airport again, but this time the family and I were off to Fiji (again). This time for our originally planned trip. This time we spent a week in a resort on Denerau Island. It was an entirely different experience to the earlier trip, both were enjoyable, and I can't wait to go back.

## Blogging

Nothing crazy this month, struggling to find the time among everything else to write. I haven't come across too many posts recently that have sparked a need to riff off, either. I still want to get back into the habit of posting shorter, whatever type posts that I used to again.

- [Apple AirPods 4](/posts/apple-airpods-4/) What a fantastic set of ear buds that can do active noise-cancelling without a seal.
- [How Do I IndieWeb?](/posts/how-do-i-indieweb/) The IndieWeb is more than just webmentions. It's about having your own website, sharing links to other websites, and being part of communities that work towards building a better web.
- [What If Encore Never Leaked?](/posts/what-if-encore-never-leaked/) The 20th anniversary of Encore came and went with nothing but a re-release of the vinyl in a new variant colour. A missed opportunity to release the original track list. So I got blogging about what if the original tracks for meant for Eminem's fifth studio album Encore never leaked?

## Reading

Not a bad month of books. I started with the Infinity Gate after seeing its follow-up Echo of Worlds in a bookshop at the airport. I then got stuck into Moonstorm by Yoon Ha Lee, which I must have put a hold on with my library ages ago and forgot about it. While in Fiji, I pulled out the Kobo to enjoy Hostile Takeover and wrap up the Emerald City Spy series (such a fun set of books) and finished up listening to Freakenomics which was a fantastic set of essays connected through economics.

## Music

The alternate cover of [The Death Of Slim Shady (Coup De GrÃ¢ce)](/recordshelf/#the-death-of-slim-shady-(coup-de-grace)) arrived, and I swiftly added it to my collection.

## Gaming

I really haven't done much gaming this month. We've wrapped up raiding for Season One of The War Within and outside that I've had no desire to play Warcraft. I'll most likely not get Key Stone Master, nor enough bronze to collect all the Tier-2 transmog sets from the anniversary event.

I am looking forward to getting back into Cyberpunk this month. Looking forward to that!

## Website

Something that had been bugging me for a while was the length of the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) page. It's gotten out of hand recently, so I've managed to add pagination to the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) page for easier browsing. I'll take a look of exposing the tagging system at some point, my first couple tries failed spectacularly.

I wasn't a fan of the half finished look of the previous homepage layout, so I've added some cohesion to the grid. I think it looks a lot better than the last iteration.

## Happening across the web

I totally forgot to mention this last month, 32 Bit community member, [ajazz](https://downtheladder.net/) recently started a newsletter Called [From The Superhighway](https://fromthesuperhighway.com/). From The Super Highway is a monthly newsletter and interview series where ajazz looks out for the most interesting projects across the indie web. The first issue features an interview with [Melonking](https://melonking.net/), and the second features me and the other 32 Bit Cafe team, check out issue 2: [Search Engine Deoptimization and e-Baristas!](https://fromthesuperhighway.com/issues/issue02)

I feel cheeky, drafting this on the 3rd and sending it out on the 9th, lol. Catch you up, laterz ðŸ‘‹
