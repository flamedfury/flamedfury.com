What's up, Internet? I watched Wu-Tang: An American Saga as it aired. I intended to write a quick post once it wrapped up, but I never did. For day two of [WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024), I'm sharing those thoughts. I still think about this show often.

Wu-Tang: An American Saga is a dramatised retelling of the Wu-Tang Clan's formation, recording of their first two group records, and recording and releasing each of the main crew's solo records.

The story is told across three seasons of ten episodes each. 

Season one focuses on the group's formation, season two on recording the 36 Chambers album, and season three on the solo records. It ends with Wu-Tang Forever, their tour with Rage Against The Machine, and their fallout as a group.

Episodes would take a different direction, focus on a single character, and dive into their story, which continues throughout each season.

I love the music throughout the show. Watching any scene where the iconic tracks are recorded for the first time gave me goosebumps.

The one thing I wasn't happy about was the casting of RZA; the actor just didn't vibe with what I knew RZA looked and talked like. Everyone else was okay. But now that I think about it, Dave East as Method Man was quite annoying as they both have distinct voices, and Dave East's voice is definitely not Method Man's voice.

My favourite episode was season three, episode eight, "Liquid Swords". [Liquid Swords]() by the GZA is my favourite Wu solo album, and watching this episode the way the story was told was awesome, especially watching them play out each of the iconic tracks. Watching/listening to ODB deliver the hook for Duel of the Iron Mic in this wild story was something to behold.

If you love music, you should enjoy it. You could watch this happily without any Wu knowledge, but it is even better if you're at least a little bit into Wu. I enjoyed remembering it so much that I'm going to queue it up and watch it again!
