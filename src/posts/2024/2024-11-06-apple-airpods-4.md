What's happening, Internet? I recently picked up a new pair of Apple AirPods 4 with active noise cancelling to replace an older pair whose battery was giving up. I'm happy to report that these little earbuds are fantastic.

The active noise cancelling works perfectly for me. There is just enough noise cancelling for me, allowing me to still be aware of my surroundings while being perfectly comfortable in my ear. Being aware of my surroundings is crucial for me while walking my dog, as I like to hear approaching traffic, whether it's on the road or rapidly reversing down a driveway.

I tried Airpods Pro once and couldn't stand the in ear seal. The way that these AirPods do noise cancelling without the seal is fantastic.

I've been using these in adaptive mode, and they work great switching in and out of varying levels of noise cancelling depending on the situation. Again, while out walking the dog, the noise cancelling helps keep the volume of the wind down so I can still focus on what I'm listening to. This works the same back inside the house and is amazing for when I've got the extractor fan going in the kitchen while cooking or cruising around the house with the vacuum cleaner.

I've played with the conversation awareness setting, which has been great for a quick hello to neighbours while out walking but is no good when back in the home gym working out singing along to the music. I will look into setting up focus modes that turn this setting on or off depending on whether I'm out dog walking or working out.

These things sound incredible to my non audiophile ears. They're the perfect companion to pair with the AppleTV in the bedroom instead of the TV speakers (as they sound terrible). Watching TV shows in bed on the odd occasion without disrupting the sleeping kid next door is a massive bonus while also sounding amazing.

And finally, the new case is smaller than any AirPods model yet and has USB-C and MagSafe. I'm happy to report that my phone is the last remaining device not on USB-C, which will be updated in a couple years (iPhone 13). I've seen various videos and posts about the MagSafe not being strong enough and unable to attach to vertical MagSafe docks. Well, the charger dock I have on my desk holds them perfectly.

I love these things.
