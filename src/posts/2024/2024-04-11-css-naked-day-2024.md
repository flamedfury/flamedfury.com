I was alerted to [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/) over on the [forums](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/css-naked-day-2024/752/30) on a thread started by [Ravenous](https://chrisburnell.com/).

CSS Naked Day is one full day each year, on the 9th of April, where participants remove CSS from their websites and expose their unstyled HTML to the world. 

The idea behind CSS Naked Day is to promote web standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, [semantic markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html), a good [hierarchy structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure), and of course, a good old play on words.

I didn't manage to sort out any automated way to remove the stylesheet for the entire fifty hours, but if you browsed the website any time during the last 24 hours you would have seen Flamed Fury in it's styleless glory.

The website held up very well, I only had to fix up the sizing of two SVG files. They were quickly fixed with a `width` and `height` attribute.

You may have noticed that the screenshot shows that the page still had dark mode styling. This was not because of CSS but a handy tag you can have in your page's `<head>` section, `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />`

Frills shared an awesome write up and breakdown on what she did and fixed for the event. Check it out over on her page, [Stripping down to my HTML](https://frills.dev/blog/240409-css-naked/).

I'm looking forward to next year where I'll hopefully be better prepared.
