What's happening Internet? For day 12 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024]), I'm going to share one of the greatest Hip-Hop tracks (and video) to come out of Aotearoa. The early 2000s were huge for local Hip-Hop. Between 1999 and 2008, during Helen Clark's Labour government, during which she served as Minister for Arts, NZ music got a big push across NZ Media.

2003 saw the release of Scribe's [Crusader](https://musicthread.app/link/2gMYkAkX4lvauivyfgoKuAZASKL), which, to me, was the biggest local Hip-Hop release ever. It was wild that this was local music.

The first single, "Stand Up," became an anthem for Aotearoa Hip-Hop. It featured the song "Not Many" on the b-side and started gaining traction. Rather than releasing Stand Up as the next single, they decided to record and release a remix. Because of that decision, the entire country was happy, and we ended up with this legendary track, "Not Many—The Remix!". Enjoy.
