What's going on, Internet? This one has been bouncing around my head for months now, and I've had this draft open for the past three weeks. It's time to get it out of my head and onto the web.

Recently, on [our forums](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/), community member Manatee asked, "[What does 'rewilding the internet' mean to you?](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/what-does-rewilding-the-internet-mean-to-you/1089)" This got me thinking about the concept of "rebuilding the web" and what it means to foster independent web communities.

This post isn't about rewilding the web or building out new infrastructure to compete with big tech, but how we, as members and participants of the independent web, can help rebuild the connections that made the web diverse and fun to surf again.

I've [discussed similar themes](https://flamedfury.com/tags/web/) on fLaMEd Fury before, and [others](https://michal.sapka.me/blog/2024/send-links/) [have](https://www.ease.gg/2020/05/07/everything-nothing/) [written](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/sharing-links-via-rss-sharing-links-via-apis/) about the [importance of linking](https://flamedfury.com/posts/the-art-of-hyperlinking/) and the dislike of big platforms that are hostile to everyday web surfers like you and me.

We can all actively participate in rebuilding the web by having our own independent websites and linking to each other's websites whenever and wherever possible.

Delyo said it best on a recent rant about [how hard it is to find the indie web](https://garden.delyo.be/rants/finding-the-indieweb/):

> So if you have a site, if your friend has a site, you can easily create a web link directory or a blogroll. This won't impact your site directly, but it will heal the wounds of the disconnected web and make it normal to surf again.

For this to work, we might have to leave our egos at the door sometimes and not get [down](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-really-like-everyone-on-my-blogroll-but-im-sorry-to-say-that-it-must-die/) if we [don't](https://notes.jeddacp.com/to-blogroll-or-to-not/) find ourselves on someone else's blogroll. Don't [hesitate](https://wand3r.net/blogroll-slashpage/) or [question](https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/re-blogroll-or-not/) it, do it. What's the worst that can happen? You can even [automate](https://bacardi55.io/2024/03/03/adding-a-blogroll-from-my-rss-reader/) your [blogroll](https://melkat.blog/p/blogroll) if you don't want to think about it too much, but I would miss the context of why you like those particular sites.

When you come across an awesome post that someone has written, start a [bookmarks](/bookmarks/) page to [share](https://chrisburnell.com/bookmarks/) with your [friends](https://coryd.dev/links/). If you don't want to go that far, [véronique](https://veronique.ink/) manages to [share links](https://veronique.ink/poetry-links/) in every other post.

Join a [Webring](/posts/relics-of-the-web/#webrings) if they're relevant to your website, and list your website in a [directory](/links/#webdirs)—there are heaps of them now.

Create a page or write a post about unique and niche interests, and share them with your friends and the wider community. This could encourage others to create their own pages or posts, link to yours, and create new communities. Use your website to facilitate a conversation across the web. This is what Webmentions were made for!

There are so many things that we can keep on doing to rebuild the web we want—a web full of vibrant and diverse websites and communities that help foster a more open, inclusive, and connected Internet for everyone.
