Hello web surfers, where did February go? We're right into March already, so I'm a bit late with this post.

I spoke about writing less [last month](/posts/monthly-recap-january-2024/), and I've outdone myself during February with only two posts! Don't worry, there's a good reason for that.

+ [Making Websites Should Be Easy](/posts/making-websites-should-be-easy/): Creating a website can be daunting, especially for non-developers. As someone well aware of the struggles with the process, I spoke with [Sara](https://sarajoy.dev/) on Mastodon about [simplifying the process of creating a website for non-developers](https://social.lol/@flamed/111730917308541254) on the back end of a recent post, "[An Easy Web](/posts/an-easy-web)".
+ [Building My Comics Page](/building-my-comics-page/): My [comics page](/comics/) sat empty for years. I finally sat down and did something about it using eleventy-fetch and League of Comic Geeks. In this post, I detail how I did it.

Anyway, I was busy behind the scenes working on the website itself. With the recent release of [Eleventy-Excellent 2.0](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/), I took the time to rehaul the entire backend; converting everything was slow. The great thing was that many of the additions I'd hacked in over the past year are now part of Eleventy Excellent. 

I still have a few more improvements to make; we'll see how that goes.

Also, me and the [32-Bit](https://32bit.cafe/) mod team—[xandra](https://xandra.cc/), [Yequari](https://yequari.com/), [Key](https://keysklubhouse.com/), [Jay](https://transrats.neocities.org/), and [Kaylee](https://kaylee.wtf/)—launched the new [32-Bit Cafe Forums](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/) to great response. We've had 150 members sign up, and there are heaps of great discussions happening already. Come join us if you're into website building for fun.

Catch you all next month, laters.
