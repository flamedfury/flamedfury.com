What's going on Internet? Miley Cyrus, a dynamic musical force and should be celebrated for her daring metamorphoses. She takes us on a touching journey through the contrasting narratives of [We Can't Stop](https://musicthread.app/link/2hECY3lfDFoyko6nwkwvuKseMrj), [Slide Away](https://musicthread.app/link/2hECY12BaeHyGJEhkQ8KxfDPRoe), and her recent single [Jaded](https://musicthread.app/link/2hEF0hlY81opHVfsJQJ85s9jBWQ). Each song is a window into different chapters of Miley's life and emotional landscape, revealing her growth and resilience in a deeply personal and relatable way.

In 2019, Miley unveiled Slide Away, a soul-stirring ballad that emerged as a breakup anthem, possibly influenced by her separation from her long-time on-and-off partner, Liam Hemsworth. Produced by [Mike WiLL Made It](https://www.eardrummer.co/), Slide Away marked a pivotal moment in Miley's musical journey.

The single, released after her earlier work in May 2019, [She Is Coming](https://musicthread.app/link/2hECY0BO4B3gZRcXshCbGCwwzOc), became a reflective piece following her divorce from Hemsworth in August 2019. This concluded a decade-long relationship that began during the filming of [The Last Song](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/35690-the-last-song) in 2009 and eventual marriage in December 2018.

The lyrics reference the paradise that once existed, the feeling of being paralysed, and the realisation that it's time to let go. Miley confronts the evolution of their relationship in the bridge, acknowledging the inevitable changes that come with growing up, asserting,

> "Move on, we're not seventeen.
> I'm not who I used to be."

During this, Miley faced accusations of infidelity, which she adamantly denies as the reason behind the breakup. The situation's complexity is addressed in the lyrics, and she reinforces her truth in a tweet, declaring herself not a liar but someone who will always love Liam.

She reinforced these sentiments in Slide Away's second verse,

> "Once upon a time, it was made for us
> Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
> Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
> So it's time to let it go."

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrvFv6j3-sM) for Slide Away provides a visually compelling narrative, drawing parallels with [We Can't Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco&pp=ygUNd2UgY2FuJ3Qgc3RvcA%3D%3D). I wholeheartedly believe that Slide Away serves as a spiritual successor, depicting the aftermath of the wild party in We Can't Stop. In this visual metaphor, Miley stands amidst the remnants of the party, with lingering guests sprawled across the house, representing the morning after the night's celebration.

We Can't Stop showcases a young Miley embracing a carefree party lifestyle, a declaration of living in the moment without constraints. Fast forward a decade to Slide Away, and we witness a more mature and reflective Miley. The video unfolds with symbols of a concluded party... Empty glasses and discarded decorations... This starkly contrasts the vibrant scenes of We Can't Stop. Miley, now alone, sings of the pain of loss and the necessity of letting go. The video beautifully captures the theme of growth and maturity, signifying the end of one chapter and the anticipation of new beginnings.

In Jaded, Miley continues this introspective journey, exploring themes of regret and missed opportunities. Jaded delves into the emotional aftermath of a relationship, capturing a sense of longing and self-reflection. The lyrics resonate with anyone who has experienced the lingering pain of a lost connection; as Miley sings,

>"I coulda taken you places,
>You're lonely now and I hate it.
>I'm sorry that you're jaded."

The raw vulnerability in Jaded adds another layer to the evolving narrative. It bridges the youthful exuberance of We Can't Stop and the sad acceptance of Slide Away with a reflection on what might have been. The song's introspective tone reveals Miley's continued growth as an artist, willing to confront her past and express her emotions candidly. This emotional depth in her music deeply moves me, and I'm sure others can relate.

To me, We Can't Stop, Slide Away, and Jaded stand as bookends, representing the dynamic range of Miley Cyrus's artistry and evolution. The former exudes unapologetic hedonism, celebrating the freedom of the moment. The latter two beautiful ballads navigate heartache, regret, and growth. Together, they form a narrative arc mirroring the ebbs and flows of life, attesting to the transformative power of music and Miley's capacity to resonate across a spectrum of emotions. Her journey becomes a shared experience, inviting fans to find solace, strength, and beauty in the evolving chapters of the human experience.

Who hasn't gone through such a transformation or realisation in life?
