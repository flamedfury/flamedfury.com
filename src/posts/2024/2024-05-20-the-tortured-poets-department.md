What's up Internet? I can't believe this is the twentieth post for [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/), May is almost over already.

Yesterday I spent the afternoon in the kitchen meal prepping while enjoying a couple beers. I had the Sonos Roam speaker on the bench playing music from PlexAmp. I finally got around to listening to all two hours of [The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology](https://musicthread.app/link/2givWtJQqjrvKdntqoXkN7ZQpEq) by Taylor Swift. 

It's definitely a Taylor Swift album. It was weird hearing her say fuck so many times. I miss Love Story, and You Belong To Me, Taylor Swift.
