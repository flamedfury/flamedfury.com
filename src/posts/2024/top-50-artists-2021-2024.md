What's going on Internet? As it's the end of the day and I need to sleep for day 9 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo/) I'm going to dump my Top 50 Artists from 1 Mar 2021 - 9 May 2024. 

This is my second Last.fm account. My previous one was scrobbling since 2012 but I managed to lose all that data. I would have loved to have seen what the top 50 looked like over those twelve years. 

Due to this, I will find some focus time and follow Cory's guidance for importing my [Last.fm data to ListenBrainz](https://coryd.dev/posts/2023/programmatically-importing-your-lastfm-listening-data-to-listenbrainz/) and eventually [self-host my listening data](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/improving-my-self-hosted-scrobbling-implementation/) too.

Anyway, for some fun, here's my top 50. Enjoy, have a laugh or find something new to listen to.

Pssst. May is [NZ Music Month](https://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz/) so in the spirit I reccommend [Home Brew](https://homebrewcrew.bandcamp.com/) and [Avantdale Bowling Club](https://avantdalebowlingclub.bandcamp.com/) as a taste for some Aotearoa Hip-Hop.
