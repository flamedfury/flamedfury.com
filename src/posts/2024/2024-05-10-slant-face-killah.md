Ayyo, what's up Internet? I last wrote about Conway [four years ago](/posts/no-one-mourns-the-wicked/). The intention was to post more about him and his records but for reasons it never happened. What better opportunity than day 10 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/) and the release day for [Slant Face Killah]().

Conway has been my favourite Griselda member since stumbling across them in 2015's Griselda Ghost. You can see in [yesterday's post](/posts/top-50-artists-2021-2024/) he's the second artist in my top 50 right after Miley.

I wasn't even following anything about this album after giving up on Conways records during 2023. I'm super glad I picked this one up this morning and managed to listen through while walking the dogs. 

This album feels like a throwback to classic Conway The Machine. Grimey beats, filthy lyrics, simple times.

The standout track on this album is Mutty (Feat. Stove God Cooks). This is the exact reason why I fell in love with Conways music back then and I want more tracks like this. I also understand that an artist can't continue making the same song forever. However, Conways done a good job at making different versions on this type of record for last few years. I'm here for it.

I feel like the track Meth Back! should have been called something else and dropped the SK Da King and Flee Lord features and stuck with another Conway and Method Man collab like 2020's <span class="gradient-text">FIRE</span> track Lemon (Ft. Method Man).

Halfway through the album, Dasani is another standout track. Classic Conway. In fact, all his solo tracks on this joint are <span class="gradient-text">FIRE</span>.

Product is fire most of the way through. 

Can't wait to wake up tomorrow and listen some more.

Laters.
