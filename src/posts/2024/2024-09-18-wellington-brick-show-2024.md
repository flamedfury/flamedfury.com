What's up, Internet? In the continued efforts to keep our young family entertained on the weekends we decended upon the [Wellington Brick Show 2024](https://www.well-lug.nz/upcoming-events/wellington-brick-show-2024) put on by the [Wellington Lego User Group](https://www.well-lug.nz/).

If you think that all we do is attend Lego shows and exhibits, well, we don't... There's just a few of them on around the country at the moment :P

We all really enjoyed the show. There was a great selection of incredible Lego builds on display with lots of great themes. As we entered the show room we were greeted by a lego portrait of Taylor Swift.

My favourite was a recreation of part of Leeds Street in Wellington featuring the Fortune Favours Brewery and Tap Room and the Gorilla Burger Container.

There were a few displays of Lego that I remember from my childhood. The eighties space collection, you know the ones, with the red, blue, green, yellow dudes, and some of the nineties pirates set that I remember having (and still might have up in the attic).

Star Wars was very popular. Lots of the big sets on display like the Super Star Destroyer that was almost the same size as the length of my arms outstretched and what I figure was a custom build toddler sized R2D2.

My son was excited to see the display of the Lego Speed cars as we've collected and built a few of those together.

The Wellington Lego User Group looks to do a lot of charity donations through the club. They had a few raffles going over the weekend and I brought a few tickets but never got the call.

They also had a scavenger hunt going that kept my son entertained throughout our time there. Twelve of the displays had hidden mini figs hidden in the displays that you had to find to recieve a stamp on your card. He managed to complete the challenge and entered the prize drawer but I don't think we were selected as a winner.

Overall it was a fun morning out and got me excited for more Lego building. I better put some time aside and finish building my [Optimus Prime](https://www.lego.com/en-nz/product/optimus-prime-10302).

I took some photos from the display.
