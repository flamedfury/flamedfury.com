What's happening, Internet? I'm finally back home after two weeks of travelling with the family. I had grand ideas of having kid free time on the beach and sitting down to flesh out a few drafts I had on the go, but no such luck.

We had a fantastic seven nights in Fiji in a quiete resort at the bottom of the main island. River boating and tubing, visiting local villages, sea kyaking and paddle boarding, visits to local wild life parks, massages and beautiful sunsets made a magical trip. Unfortunately I got slammed with the flu about halfway through and I'm still recovering from that. It's been over seven days now, and I can't wait to feel better.

Anyway, let's see what I got up too during August...

## Blogging

Annoyingly another light month for me. I have many things in draft, trust me. I just hope that too much time doesn't pass and they end up feeling irrellevent. I have a draft of notes about The Death Of Slim Shady and the experience of listening to it with friends the night it dropped, but that was ages ago all the way back in July now, that ship's most likely sailed now...

- [Millennial Energy](/posts/millennial-energy/) was a simple reply to a post from [Jedda](https://jeddacp.com/) about growing up in the nineties.
- [What's Your Style?](/posts/whats-your-style/) came about re-reading a post by [Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/) got me thinking about the simple naming of a style sheet. I encouraged response by website and I got a few!
- [IndieWeb 101](/posts/indieweb-101/) was my entry for our [Back To School](https://32bit.cafe/~xandra/events/codejam5/) code jam over at the [32 Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/). A fun way to intro both the Indie Web and the IndieWeb and provide an easy way to participate in the "IndieWeb".

## Reading

I don't know what happened but I got through a lot of books this month. Some easy reads along with a fantastic book by a local author.

- The Consortium Rebellion by [Jesse Meihalik](https://www.jessiemihalik.com/). [Polaris Rising](https://www.jessiemihalik.com/book/polaris-rising/), [Aurora Blazing](https://www.jessiemihalik.com/book/aurora-blazing/), and [Chaos Reigning](https://www.jessiemihalik.com/book/chaos-reigning/). Easy read books with a bit of romance (smut) thrown in. Each book progresses the overall story but told from the perspetive of a different character form the same family. Enjoyed this series.

- [The Mercy Of Gods](https://www.jamessacorey.com/books/the-mercy-of-gods/) by The Exapanse's James S.A. Corey dives into a new universe seperate from the expanse. A story of alien invasion, abduction and adjusting to life under the rule of the aliens. No politics or military, just a group of scientific researchers trying to survive in a wild situation. Excited to see what comes next.

- [Max](https://bookhub.co.nz/p/max-2695301) from local author Avi Duckor-Jones tells an insightful coming of age story about finding out what you want in life, as well as who you are. Made me uncomfortable at times, but what a fantastic story. Give it a read.

- While on Fiji I loaded up a few of [Cheri Baker's](https://cheribaker.com/) books onto my Kobo to read on the beach. [Involuntary Turnover](https://cheribaker.com/products/involuntary-turnover) her first book, an easy going murder mystery set in a hospital, I enojoyed it enough but not sure if I'll pick up the rest. [The Assistant](https://cheribaker.com/products/the-assistant) the first book in the Emerald City Spies series, how would you manage if you unwillingly got recruited into a spy agency? I'm interested enough to read the other two books. And finally, [Outlaw Justice](https://cheribaker.com/products/outlaw-justice), her latest series set on Mars. Excited to see where the next book takes the story!

## Music

Two new records added to the [collection](/recordshelf/).

- I finally found a copy of Eminem's cult classic, [Relapse](/recordshelf/#relapse). Only a few left to complete his discography on wax.
- Did you know that The Alchemist also raps, and is in a group called Gangrene with fello producer/rapper Oh No? Well, it's a thing, and [Heads I Win, Tails You Lose](/recordshelf/#heads-i-win-tails-you-lose) arrived in the mail this month.

## Bookmarks

I read some good posts this month, unfortunately I didn't manage to save all of them here. I've still got a browser window full of tabs that need to be bookmarked and shared.

## Website

I finally upgraded to [11ty v3.0.0-beta.1](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/three-point-oh-beta-one/). All CommonJS modules converted to ESM. No issues this time round. Now I'm looking forward to the 3.0 stable release.

Updated the [Comics](/comics/) page with my latest pulls.

The top navigation has had a refresh, to highlight popular pages like the [Bookshelf](/bookshelf/), [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/), and [Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) pages alongside [Posts](/posts/), and [Now](/now/) page. I expect to play around with this further as well as fixing my bottom navigation while also showcasing a link to every page on the website on the homepage.

I Fixed the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) pages and [Atom feed](/bookmarks-feed.xml) to fix issues I was having with [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app).

With the help of [Chris](https://chrisburnell.com/), I re-added Webmentions support with the latest version of [eleventy-webmentions-cache](https://chrisburnell.com/eleventy-cache-webmentions/). This was partially inspired by [Scott Jones's Web Notes](https://rscottjones.com/webnotes/) and [Jedda's Community Echos](https://notes.jeddacp.com/implementing-community-echoes/). A no fuss simple list of URLs to other websites that mention any particular post. No likes, no boosts, no social media back feed.

And finally, a new section for the [links page](/links/) page. [Bookmarks & Link Blogs](/links/#linkblogs). These are links to other people who are doing similar link sharing like I do with my [Bookmarks](/bookmarks).

## Around the web

The discourse for August has been around the Indie Web and the IndieWeb. What's the difference? I thought I wrote a good description on the [IndieWeb 101](/posts/indieweb-101/) post.

This all kicked off again when [Simone Silvestroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/) shared a post [Smaller](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/smaller/) which got [Starbreaker](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html) going with his unapologetic post [Has the IndieWeb Become Irrelevant?](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html). [fyr](https://fyr.io/) jumped in with a simple [IndieWeb vs indie web](https://fyr.io/post/indieweb_vs_indie_web) post which caused Starbreaker to update their post. Then [Marty McGuire](https://martymcgui.re/) jumps in with [Has the IndieWeb Become Discourse Again?](https://martymcgui.re/2024/08/29/141602/) which sees another update from Starbreaker. I managed to [bookmark](/bookmarks) most of these as they happened along with a couple older ones.

They're all good reads and get you thinking about how we as a wider community can make the web and website building more accessible and [easy](/posts/making-websites-should-be-easy/) for [everyone](/posts/an-easy-web/).

I wanted to get in on this one so much but the family holiday took priority. I've got a bunch of notes that I can't wait to post soon. I'll update here when it's published.

Anyway, I've got some Warcraft to catch up on. Wake me up when September ends, laters ðŸ‘‹
