What's going on Internet? For day 18 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024) I'm jumping back to [music](/tags/music/) to ask a very serious question: Why do you like Nirvana?

This came up after a heavy Nirvana listening session this weekend, and my wife commented that she realised that she doesn't actually like Nirvana. I have no issue with that, but it made me reflect on why I like Nirvana. I also want to know whether you like Nirvana and why.

I didn't get into Nirvana until after Kurt Cobain's death. I was aware of them but only got into them heavily once some older friends got me into them. I loved the seemingly random and nonsensical lyrics, the lack of melodies, and the raw emotion in the performances. I loved the differences in performance between album versions of songs and the live performance on the [MTV Unplugged album](https://musicthread.app/link/2gdYqQBciMb38rM8ydWXsJ1U7LL). 

What about you? Are you a casual Teen Spirit fan, or do you get deep into records like [Aneurysm](https://musicthread.app/link/2gdZ65bVA9cUsp8EztyDghAwUrU)?
