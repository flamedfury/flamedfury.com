What's going on, Internet? Well, I drafted this on Thursday the 31st of October and am finally publishing it today. A long weekend away with family and juggling kids and sickness across the family didn't lend itself to having any free time for any website work! Such is life, hey?

## Blogging

-   [The Genuine Articulate](/posts/the-genuine-articulate/)
-   [New Music Friday #2](/posts/new-music-friday-2/)
-   [Firefox, From The Ashes?](/posts/firefox-from-the-ashes/)
-   [The Death Of Slim Shady](/posts/the-death-of-slim-shady/)

## Reading

* [Freaks Gleaks & Dawsons Creek ](/bookshelf/freaks-gleeks-and-dawsons-creek/)by Thea Glassman is a fantastic read if you're like me and into these types of TV shows from the 90s and early 2000s.
* [The Playground](/bookshelf/playground/) by [50 Cent](https://www.50cent.com/) was a great short story that didn't take too long to get through.
* [Hate](/bookshelf/hate/), [Liar](/bookshelf/liar/), [Fake](/bookshelf/fake/), and [Kate](bookshelf/kate/) by [Tate James](https://www.tatejamesauthor.com/) was a two week journey that I'm not afraid to say that I absolutely enjoyed. The plot of these books was outright bonkers, but enjoyable at the same time. I'm planning on getting into the rest of the books in the Shadow Grove universe.
* [The Nineties](/bookshelf/the-nineties/) by [Chuck Klosterman](https://chuckklostermanauthor.com/) was an okay read, it was maybe 50/50 pop culture and American politics.

## Music

The first of two copies of [The Death Of Slim Shady](/recordshelf/#the-death-of-slim-shady-(coup-de-grace)) arrived. This one was the original cover, still waiting for the alternative artwork cover to ship. Check out my recent post, [The Death Of Slim Shady](/posts/the-death-of-slim-shady/) where I reminence anticpating, and enjoying music together with friends.

## Gaming

Again this month, with what little time I've had for gaming has been spent with The War Within Season One. With my guild, we've managed to clear Heroic [Nerub-ar Palace](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/raids/nerubar-palace/overview) pretty quickly, and only needed 70 pulls to defeat [Queen Ansurek](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=219778/queen-ansurek). I'm not fully into Mythic+ this season, but I'm over halfway to getting Keystone Hero Master so I might end up finishing it. I'll be sure to put up a wrap up post near the end of Season One to recap notable achievements.

I'm really looking forward to getting back into Cyberpunk!

## Bookmarks

It's not that HTML and CSS aren‚Äôt simple, they both be simple and difficult at the same time. It‚Äôs that static site generators are still slightly out of touch with the non developer. Just take a look at what‚Äôs getting built across places like Neocities or Nekoweb to get a glance on what non developers are able to do with HTML and CSS and no SSG‚Ä¶

## Website

Not too many changes this month, and not all that I wanted to get done. I upgraded the backend to [Eleventy 3.0.0](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/) and tidied up the site structure and configuration based on [Lene Saile's](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/#update-june-2024) guide.

## Happening around the web

### At the Cafe

Over at the [32 Bit Cafe](https://32-bit.cafe/) we held our [annual Halloween event](https://32bit.cafe/halloween24/). This year members participated by [dressing up their websites](https://32bit.cafe/halloween24/#costumes), [virtual trick or treating](https://32bit.cafe/halloween24/#doors), [wrote](https://32bit.cafe/halloween24/#writing) , and [experimentations](https://32bit.cafe/halloween24/#frankensite). Big shout out to [xixxii](https://xixxii.neocities.org/) for putting together the fantastic event page.

### Everything else

[Blake Watson](https://blakewatson.com/) published his digital book [HTML For People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) this month. What I love about this book is that Blake really drives the message home that HTML is accessible to everyone, not just those in the tech industry. He believes that anyone can create a website using  HTML, regardless of their prior experience with coding or web design.

Blake's goal is to teach anyone the basics of HTML without a focus on CSS and friendly and approachable manner with the aim to empower anyone to build their own website.

If you're ready to start your own website dive into this book and come and join us at the [Cafe Forums](https://discourse.32-bit.cafe) to join a community of like minded people.

If you're curious on how Blake approached this project, he's provided a great write up over on his blog, [The making of HTML for People](https://blakewatson.com/journal/the-making-of-html-for-people/).


Sweeet, catch you up, laterz üëã
