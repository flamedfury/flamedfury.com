Aye yo Internet, doot doot doot doot. They don't make them like this anymore. Griselda Records, the original home of Westside Gunn, Conway The Machine, and Benny the Butcher. The original lineup on [Griselda Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griselda_Records) distinguished themselves with their gritty lyricism, vintage production, and unapologetic street narratives. Griselda puts out the type of music that makes you want to go outside and ride your bike without a helmet.

Their journey to infamy kicked off with 2015's [Griselda Ghost](https://musicthread.app/link/2guNfuF1Hvv4ZpCqOlwXeAg77lV), a collaborative effort between ex blogger and up and coming producer [Big Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ghost), and brothers Westside Gunn and Conway The Machine. Griselda Ghost was quickly followed by a series of critically acclaimed releases some would consider classics: Westside Gunn's [Flygod](https://musicthread.app/link/2guNfsmtXZ7eYl6Wj57s9sSy4p2), Conway's [Reject 2](https://musicthread.app/link/2guNfu9YubkycDTN7X661X1LPPD), and Benny's [Tana Talk 3](https://musicthread.app/link/2guNfp9pUyzWVsiJy2pJYgf51OU). 

In 2019 they released their first and only group album on a major record label [WWCD](https://musicthread.app/link/2guPoT7OaGaJByMUexuWBQa0YGd) which showcased their chemistry, brought them up from the underground, and solidified their position in mainstream hip-hop. 

As they continued to gain momentum and expand their influence, with Griselda Records' undeniable impact on the rap game, set the stage for a new era of boom bap in the 2020s.

Conway has since left the label to focus on his solo career and grow his artists on his own record label, Benny is out there doing his thing chasing mainstream success while Westside Gunn continues to grow the label with a new roster of talent.

Salute to the kings of the underground.
