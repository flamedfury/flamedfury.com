How's it going Internet? Following [yesterday's post](/posts/everything-is-recorded-friday-forever/) about albums you can sit down and listen to front to back without any skips, I wanted to use day 4 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/weblogpomo2024/) to share another "perfect" album. 

My second perfect album is [Swimming](/recordshelf/#swimming) by Mac Miller.

I wasn't ever a huge Mac Miller fan. Sure, but I did have some of his tracks on a mixtape that I listened to while snowboarding. I never actively sought out his music. 

I love to play his record after a couple of quiet ones at home or after getting back from the pub; it's enjoyable after a cheeky smoke.

As soon as the needle hits the first track, I don't skip any song. The run from "Come Back to Earth" to "Self Care" is blissful. After that, I'm in the moment of the record, and I can't stop listening.

Listening to this album doesn't make me nostalgic like yesterday's post did; instead, it keeps me grounded in the present moment. It's bittersweet to listen to it today, knowing what eventually happened to Mac.

It feels like the party is over. 

The record blends hip-hop and jazz; it's super chill. I bet that you'll all enjoy it. 

Give it a listen, and let me know what you think.
