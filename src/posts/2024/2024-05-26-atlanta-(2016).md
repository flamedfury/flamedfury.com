What's happening Internet? Day 26 of [#WeblogPoMo2024](/tags/)...

I'm Wrapping up [Atlanta](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/65495-atlanta) season 4. It's taken a while for me to get here as I've needed to take a break between each season. The show is incredible, surreal and makes you think. I think the best thing about it could be the episode descriptions.

Some of the stand out episodes for me were [S2E6 - Teddy Perkins](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/65495-atlanta/season/2/episode/6) and [S3E8 - New Jazz](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/65495-atlanta/season/3/episode/8). 

I don't actually recall when it switched from Earn being Paper Boi's manager and Paper Boi trying to make it but I'm here for the adventure anyway.
