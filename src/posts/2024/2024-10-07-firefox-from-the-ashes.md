What's going on, Internet? After reading Jay Hoffmann's recent post on "[Gift Of Code](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-gift-of-code/)," he recounts the moment Netscape ended and Mozilla Firefox emerged from the ashes.

> Caught in a death spiral, and backed by their employees, Netscape  instead chose to gift their browser to the open source community and  spun off Mozilla as a non-profit to take charge.
>
> For years,  Mozilla retooled the codebase, piling rewrite on top of rewrite.  Eventually, in 2004, they released Mozilla Firefox from the ashes of  Netscape, a new browser focused on modern standards support. Firefox  looked to be able to challenge even Microsoft, whoâ€™s lumbering Internet  Explorer had seen very little developments in recent years.

After re-reading the Mozilla [manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/), I realised they are still working towards a healthy internet. Their ventures into private AI and privacy-preserving advertising work towards that, but that's not what we want in our browsers, right?

I never want to see another ad online while surfing the web, so I use Firefox as a browser with a handful of add-ons that enhance my surfing experience while keeping me safe. I don't want privacy-preserving tech that allows me to be advertised safely; I don't want ads or to be tracked in any way at all. Do I need to [consider other options?](https://yequari.com/blog/2024/09/no-more-firefox/)

Can Mozilla continue to develop a browser that users adore without alienating its supporters with ventures that don't align with Firefox users' needs?

Is it time for a rebirth? Should Firefox, a browser loved by many, break free from Mozilla's revenue-driven strategies that diverge from the user's core desires: a reliable web browser, freedom, and choice on the web?

Could a user-funded model be the answer? I'm more than willing to invest in a vital piece of software that I use daily. After all, I'm already paying for search to enhance my online experience. It's worth considering...
