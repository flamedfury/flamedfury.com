Since my last post about [instant messaging](/posts/instant-messaging/) I was excited to find that I already had access to an XMPP server with my [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) membership.

Yes. Yes I do feel right at home with XMPP.

It's been great chatting with the few people who responded to the last post. If you want to chat, [just hit me up](xmpp:flamed@omg.lol).

Are you looking to get started on [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/)? It's simple; you just need an account on a server and a client.

If you're already an omg.lol member, head over to the social page on your dashboard and provision an XMPP account. Otherwise, create an account on one of [these public providers](https://providers.xmpp.net/).

Then you'll need a client; there are [lots to choose from](https://xmpp.org/software).

I'm using [Beagle](https://beagle.im/) on the Macbook, [Dino](https://dino.im/) on the Linux Desktop, and [Monal](https://monal-im.org/) on the iOS devices. 

I'm only using XMPP for the IM capabilities. I haven't joined any chatrooms yet and don't plan to. 

The [Join Jabber](https://joinjabber.org/) has a couple of sweeet [tutorials](https://joinjabber.org/tutorials/) for connecting to other networks, integrating with other Fedi services or self-hosting your own server. 

Again, if you already have an account on XMPP or decide to create one, [hit me up](xmpp:flamed@omg.lol). Happy
