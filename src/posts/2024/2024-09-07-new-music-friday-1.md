What's happening, Internet? I'm writing this on Saturday evening well after [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/) has finished. I finally got around to purchasing a bunch of music that's been sitting in my cart for the past few weeks and was in the process of downloading and transferring to my [NAS](/posts/synology-ds923/); I saw a timely topic [Today is Bandcamp Friday!](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/today-is-bandcamp-friday/1326) by [yequari](https://yequari.com/) and figured I'd kick off this series.

Today's purchases are all from local artists, new and old. Check them out.

**Caught Inside** is a local Pōneke (Wellington) band. I've picked up their most recent EP, [5 STAR SHAG](https://caughtinsidemusic.bandcamp.com/album/5-star-shag), which they released last August, as well as their 2020 EP, [Get Down in Clown Town](https://caughtinsidemusic.bandcamp.com/album/get-down-in-clown-town). While there, I grabbed a couple of their singles, [Body Down](https://caughtinsidemusic.bandcamp.com/track/body-down) and [Durry](https://caughtinsidemusic.bandcamp.com/album/durry), which features tracks from 5 STAR SHAG, but was totally worth it for the 7" vinyl to add to the [collection](/recordshelf/).

**Greatsouth** hails from Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) and has recently released a self titled project, [Greatsouth](https://greatsouthgreat.bandcamp.com/album/greatsouth), an Indie Rock album about the struggles of South Auckland. I love this concept, just check out the project description:

> Great South Road was a road built for conquest, a supply route to invade the Waikato during the Waikato Wars in the 1860s. The roll-on effects of the invasion and resulting land loss left Māori communities impoverished, second class citizens in their own country.

> I find it bittersweet that today the road is a hot bed for Māori, and many other diverse cultures and communities, commonly just referred to as Great South.

> The songs in this project shed light on the whakapapa of the road in one way or another and pays homage to working class Aotearoa.

**MC Tali** is a local D&B MC, I’ve grabbed her last project, [Future Dwellers](https://talimusic.bandcamp.com/album/future-dwellers) released in 2022. She's an amazing MC. Definitely check out [this amazing performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rFvKpQDDdU) where she's performing during a live DJ set on a boat cruising down the magnificient Milford Sound.

Finally, **Boh Runga** is a local artist who started a band [stellar\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_(New_Zealand_band)) in the early 2000s. [Right Here](https://bohrunga.bandcamp.com/album/right-here-special-bonus-edition) was her debut solo album released in 2009. This is the deluxe edition some extra songs.

If you check out any of this music, let me know what you think. Until next time, laters.
