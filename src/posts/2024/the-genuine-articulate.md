What's up, Internet? The Alchemist dropped his latest project, [The Geniune Articulate](https://musicthread.app/link/2msPlWFIf2gGnCgP0pBZz752sbg) last Friday and I've been listening, almost non stop.

It's a short project, of eight tracks spanning just 22 minutes and finishes with the Bluey influenced single, Seasons Change.

The project features verses from Alchemist himself and features from Schoolboy Q, Action Bronson, Havoc, Conway The Machine, and Larry June. While he's widely known for his production, he has been known to lay down a verse or two on his projects over the years, and I'm here for that!

If you don't want to check out the whole project, definitely check out the track [Diego Maradona](https://musicthread.app/link/2msQIPYlmQhiW5irxYBvli6C9As) for the nasty beat switch as Conway comes on to lay down his verse. Cold.

Laters.
