What's going on Internet? As we move past the halfway point of [#WeblogPoMo](/tags/weblogpomo2024), I figure I should break up the recent [TV](/tags/tv/) and [Music](/tags/music) posts and share some thoughts on some recent [comics](/tags/comics/) I've enjoyed. I read a lot of comics and haven't posted much about them here lately. This is an excellent follow-up to yesterday's X-Men post, as I read a lot of X-Men.

[The X-Terminators](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/34474/x-terminators_2022_-_2023) is a five-issue limited series run during the [Destiny of X](https://www.marvel.com/comics/guides/2269/destiny-of-x) storyline published between 2022 and 2023. Written by [Leah Williams](https://www.marvel.com/comics/creators/12972/leah_williams) and drawn by [Carlos Gomez](https://www.marvel.com/comics/creators/10355/carlos_gomez), it features Jubilee, Boom-Boom, Dazzler, and Laura Kinney (Wolverine) on a wild and crazy adventure.

The X-Terminators series stands out with its wild story, fun and hilarious dialogue, and bold and bright colours. Its narrative, which takes a break from events in Krakoa and the main X-Men books, made it appealing.

Reading the X-Terminators series was an absolute thrill. I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't resist getting the trade when it hit the shelves. 

Don't worry if you're not an X-Men fan. The X-Terminators can be enjoyed standalone without any prior knowledge of the wider X-Men story. It's an excellent read for anyone, X-Men fan or not.
