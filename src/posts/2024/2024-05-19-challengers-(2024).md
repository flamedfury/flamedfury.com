Challengers was definitely a movie. I enjoyed watching it; it was fun.

I enjoyed the slow-motion scenes, especially while the characters stood in serve positions, accompanied by the thumping club music. It made those scenes seem more exciting? That got me a message from my wife demanding the sound be turned down ðŸ˜‚ The music seemed exceptionally louder than the dialogue. I couldn't help but wonder, was the sweat dripping down their faces during those scenes added during post-production?

Zendaya was great in Challengers, although I couldn't shake her euphoric character out of my head while watching. I still need to catch Dune II.
