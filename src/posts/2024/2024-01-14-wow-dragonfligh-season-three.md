This post is a week late. I wrapped up Season Three officially at the end of last week's raid where we completed the [Glory of the Dream Raider](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19349/glory-of-the-dream-raider) achievement.

With my guild, [Ascent](https://raider.io/ascent) we achieved [Ahead of the Curve: Fyrakk the Blazing](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19350/ahead-of-the-curve-fyrakk-the-blazing), on 2023-12-17. This was our best tier yet, completing the raid on heroic difficulty 5 weeks after release. 

A day later I completed [Dragonflight Keystone Master: Season Three](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19011/dragonflight-keystone-master-season-three) where you have to attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during Dragonflight Season Three. I managed most of this season with pick up groups during the day. I didn't run much with my guild as I wasn't playing in the evenings outside of raiding.

Finishing the raiding and dungeon achievements before Christmas was great as I didn't have to worry about that while we were away up north for two weeks. This also made the season feel quite short, which isn't a bad thing particularly for me as I definitely have other things to focus on. 

Then again, we have the new patch dropping next week. Looking forward to playing through the story as it's looking to be Night Elf centric. I'm unsure what the raid and dungeon schedule is but I'm sure that I will clear both as usual.
