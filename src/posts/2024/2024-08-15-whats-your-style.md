What's happening, Internet? I was re-reading [Kenan's](https://gkeenan.co/) post, [An alarmingly concise and very hinged summary of what it was like to build this site from scratch](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-alarmingly-concise-and-very-hinged-summary-of-what-it-was-like-to-build-this-site-from-scratch/) earlier and really enjoyed [how helpful](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-alarmingly-concise-and-very-hinged-summary-of-what-it-was-like-to-build-this-site-from-scratch/#now-were-cookin-with-flamed) he found an old post of mine, [Create A Static Site Using 11ty & Deploy to Neocities](/guides/11ty-homepage-neocities/).

This brought two things front of mind:

1. Update the post.
2. I never actually detailed the Neocities deployment part. [Use this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities).

This part stuck out to me where he describes missing a step and stumbling:

> Sure, there were stumbles along the way where things didn't work as  flaMEd described, but the benefit of working through this tutorial was  that it meant I could look back a couple steps and see that I rushed  through and didn't pay close enough attention when I was coding.

> That, or it was a stupid typo. You know, `style.css` vs `styles.css`.

The old `style.css` vs `styles.css` gotchya.

I've noticed lots of tutorials and guides across the web use `style.css`. Me? I've never used it. I've always been a `styles.css` guy and always will be.

That said, for smaller projects, what do you call your style sheet? Let me know, k?
