What's happening, Internet? I managed to miss [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/) last month due to travelling so that just means I had extra in my cart for December!

Again I'm purchasing music from local artists, new and old. I hope you get a chance to check one or two of them out.

[**Kaupapa Driven Rhymes Uplifted**](https://rpmvinylnz.bandcamp.com/album/kaupapa-driven-rhymes-uplifted) by Dam Native is Aotearoa's "lost album". Recorded and released in 1997 it was widely considered one of the best hip hop albums to come out of Aotearoa. It's back with last months vinyl re-issue and availability on digital streaming platforms. Stuff have a fantastic read over on their website, [‘Lost’ Māori hip-hop classic set for new lease of life, years after going out of print](https://www.stuff.co.nz/culture/350415089/lost-maori-hip-hop-classic-set-new-lease-life-years-after-going-out-print).

[**The Rose Of Jericho**](https://georgialines.bandcamp.com/album/the-rose-of-jericho) is the debut album from Mount Maunganui singer/songwriter Georgina Lines. Smooth listening for when you just want to chill.

[**SLO MO**](https://fatfreddysdrop.bandcamp.com/album/slo-mo) is the latest album Aotearoa's very own Fat Freddy's Drop. Fat Freddy's bring their afro rhythmic funk and reggae sound to a new album that they want to be your perfect sound track to this summer.

[**Soft Power**](https://fazerdaze.bandcamp.com/album/soft-power) by Fazerdaze is an indie pop record that is best enjoyed back to back.

[C U Never](https://talimusic.bandcamp.com/track/c-u-never) and **[Gimme What I Need](https://talimusic.bandcamp.com/track/gimme-what-i-need)** by TALI are two new singles from what I imagine will be a new project from her in the future. Smooth vocal drum and bass.

If you check out any of this music, let me know what you think.

Until next time, laterz.
