I don't do Spotify, so I don't get a Spotify Wrapped in November, but I can get some interesting stats from ListenBrainz once we reached the end of the year.

This year was a good year for music for me. I got into a lot of local music this year, both old and new. It's been great revisiting local albums that were popular when I was younger, while also diving into old and new international artists.

With two young children, my music listening habits have had to change as I need to be careful with what music is played out loud while they're around. This is also why you'll see Miley, my top artist in 2022 and 2023, stay in rotation as she's Mr Three's favourite artist too now, so it's not often we don't kick off a trip to the car with Flowers.

However, with Eminem releasing [The Death Of Slim Shady](/posts/the-death-of-slim-shady/) this year, a wonderful surprise, he's taken the top spot this year as my most listened to artist and album of 2024.

2024 kicked off  Home Brew's [Mum's Stash](https://musicthread.app/link/2r0mYPB3ddO3RiQYOXqygwlRmch) being the first track I listened to, and continued to keep them in rotation, bringing them to the top of my local Aotearoa artist list for the year. The last track I listened to was Bic Runga's [Precious Things](https://musicthread.app/link/2r0pPtYFFO1HW6vZTxlDjMionQf)

I listened to **7465** tracks this year verses 2023's **8662** (-14%). **4631** of these were unique tracks.

I averaged **20 listens per day**. I managed a streak of **32 days** of listening between 17 July through to 16 August, which is crazy when you think about it where there are actual days when I might not listen to music! The day with the most listens was 28 December, with **122 songs played** during our end of year BBQ.

My **top 5 artists** out of **1235** were **Eminem**, **Miley Cyrus**, **Home Brew**, **SWIDT**, and **MOKOMOKAI**.

The 5 albums I listened to most out of **1708** were **The Death Of Slim Shady**, **Endless Summer Vacation**, **Home Brew**, **Mokomokai**, and **Relapse**.

**Sure Boy** was the least popular artist I listened to this year with a 9% popularity rating versus **Taylor Swift** who has a 100% popularity rating. 61% of my music was "mainstream"[^1]. This makes sense as [Sure Boy](/posts/sure-boy-better/) is a local band from Wellington, who have a fantastic EP by the way!

That was my 2024 in music[^2]. Let me know if you listened to any of the artists or albums after reading this. Here's some lists for you to check out. Happy New Year!
