What's going on, Internet? Tomorrow morning I will wake up and head to the gym that I've been working out in for the last 4 weeks and have my final workout.

These past four weeks have been like living in purgatory. Travelling back and forth between here and Auckland where my wife and kids have already relocated to. I've had to stay back here to finish packing up the house while also waiting for a work from home space to be made available for me up there.

Having time away from the kids is great for a short period of time, but after a couple of days I really miss my family, and the routine that comes with it.

Living in this house, that has been our family home for forever, by myself has had a mental toll on me. Working from home just adds to it as I've had to be very intentional about getting out of the house and finding other people to interact with.

So, after the first round of moving belongings and family up to Auckland I head back here to the Hutt and went back to a weird half state of back to my daily routines. With the house mostly in a packed down state I'd lost access to my home gym in the garage so I joined a gym.

This was a significant moment for me as I had not been in a gym since March 2020, the day before the world started shutting down as we prepared for COVID.

I already had a simple gym setup at home, but used the time to add to it. I ended up with a half rack, olympic bar, ez-bar, weight plates, dumbbells, kettle bells, incline benches, and my beloved spin bike. It was mighy convenient having access to a decent workout at the drop of a hat, especially when we had our first kid.

The workouts were fine, but until the other week and stepping back into the gym, with lots of equipment and machines, I'd realised how complacent I'd got with my workouts, and then how much more efficient it was to workout at the gym. I think I spent half the time in the garage re-arranging the equipment as I went through my workouts, never quite getting the exact workout I wanted.

It was also good getting back into a routing of getting up and out of bed at 5am to hit the gym at 5:30am when it opened. Even though I'd only been going for four weeks, I'd quickly become a regular and got familiar with the other early workouters. Head nods graduated into good mornings and eventually I had a little bit of interest in how I was working out. Five minute burn phases for 200 reps, anyone?

It's crazy to think that after my workout tomorrow I'll most likely never see these people again. But that's life hey?

I'll take a break next week while I get the moving stuff sorted and get settled into family routine again, but I'll be signing up at a local gym as soon as I can. Being in a new city, working from home, it will be another opportunity to maybe meet some new people.
