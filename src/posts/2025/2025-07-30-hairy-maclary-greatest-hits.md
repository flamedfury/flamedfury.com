> Out of the gate and off for a walk went Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy.

What’s going on, Internet? Last weekend the family and I took a trip over the Auckland Harbour Bridge to the North Shore to check out *Hairy Maclary’s Greatest Hits*, live on stage with Jackie Clarke and the Auckland Philharmonia.

Jackie Clarke was brilliant. Full of her usual energy and warmth, she brought the stories of Hairy Maclary and his friends from Donaldson’s Dairy to life with help from the orchestra and a lively kids' chorus.

We kicked off with the classic that started it all, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy, then rolled into Hairy Maclary and Zachary Quack, Schnitzel von Krumm’s Basketwork, Scarface Claw, Slinky Malinki Open the Door, Caterwaul Caper, and wrapped with Hairy Maclary, Sit.

Lynley Dodd’s iconic illustrations were projected up on screen, adding to the show.

A wholesome way to spend a rainy Sunday with the whānau, and a nice little hit of Kiwi nostalgia too.
