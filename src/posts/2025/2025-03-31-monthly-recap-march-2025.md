What's going on, Internet? Let's wrap up March before we get too far into April.

Some big news for me and my family is that we're embarking on an exciting new chapter, moving to TƒÅmaki Makaurau (Auckland) to support my wife's new job. This is a significant change for us, especially for me, who has happily lived in Te Awa Kairangi (Lower Hutt) all of my life. We're sad in many ways as we've built a fantastic community around the kids and all the new families we've reconnected with and met through daycare and Saturday morning activities. It will also be tough on the kids, as they've already established strong friendships with other kids in our community. However, we're also looking forward to the potential for new experiences, new community building, and being closer to my wife's family (she's originally from up there) and my brother and his family. Let's see how we go with packing.

For my sake, I've picked up Golf again after a several decade hiatus. I've enjoyed getting out on the driving range, putting green, and relearning how to play. I have written about my experience in some posts: [Golf Lessons](/posts/golf-lessons/) and [Golf Shot](/posts/golf-shot/). I will rely on Golf as a social activity to meet new people once I'm up in TƒÅmaki Makaurau.

I took some time to head over the hill to Greytown and the [Village Bookshop](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/) and attend a journal writing workshop, [The Magic Of Writing It Down](/posts/the-magic-of-writing-it-down/), I enjoyed it so much that I'm eagerly looking forward to heading back in May before the big move to attend another workshop about writing newsletters and blogs. I can't wait to see if I pick up new inspiration for writing on my website.

The other exciting thing this month was Mr Three turned four! We had a massive party at our house to celebrate. While it was busy, with around fifty people joined us. Everyone had a blast. It was an excellent opportunity to get together with our new and old friends to catch up and celebrate. The clean up wasn't too bad as most of the party happened on the back deck.

## Blogging

- [New Music Friday #4](/posts/new-music-friday-4/), Bandcramp Friday March was two weeks ago! This is what I picked up.
- [The Magic Of Writing It Down](/posts/the-magic-of-writing-it-down/), The Magic of Writing It Down: A Journaling Workshop With Dan Keane

- [Golf Shot](/posts/golf-shot/), Got myself some golf clubs.

## Reading

I started and finished two books. They were big ones that I blasted through without coming up for breath. Once I finished Onyx storm I listened to podcasts for the rest of the month.

## Music

Didn't pick up any new vinyl. Picked up a bunch of old and new release NZ music during Bandcamp Friday, check it out [New Music Friday #4](/posts/new-music-friday-4/)

## Gaming

Five weeks into The War Within Season 2 and I've been playing consistently and to a decent level. I've managed to knock out [The War Within Keystone Master: Season Two](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=41533/the-war-within-keystone-master-season-two) already and am well on my way to [The War Within Keystone Hero: Season Two](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40952/the-war-within-keystone-hero-season-two#). Raid wise we're 7/8 heroic and will be 8/8 in no time.

## Bookmarks & Website

I've not spent much time online again this month and haven't bookmarked anything or made any changes to the website. My feed reader is sitting at hundreds of unread posts from all the websites I follow, so I will cut my losses and mark them all as read for my sanity.

I've got a bunch of tabs open that I have yet to read, and I will bookmark the interesting ones soon. [Let me know](/contact) if you came across any interesting posts about the web and related topics over February and March, and I'll be happy to read them eventually.

Well, I've got a bunch of website stuff to catch up on now. I'm determined to get it all done. Catch you, laterz üëã
