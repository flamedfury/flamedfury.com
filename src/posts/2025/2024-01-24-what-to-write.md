What's going on, Internet? On a recent trip to the [Wairarapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wairarapa) we spent a kid free afternoon in [Greytown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greytown,_New_Zealand) and stopped by my favourite bookstore in the area, [Mrs Blackwell's Village Bookshop](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/). We picked up a few things, as we do and I grabbed the latest copy of [Blackwell's Buglel](https://blackwellandsons.nz/pages/blackwell-bugle) which I read later on that evening after the kids had gone to sleep and wanted to share a section of the zine that was about "what to write in a letter" that I thought most definitely apply to what to write on your own website or blog.

This should help any webmaster or webmistress at any stage of their webweaving journey.

Here's what Mrs Blackwell had to say on letter writing:

>  You do you when it comes to subject matter, but I can tell you that no one ever receives a letter from me that's an update on my entire life!

> Instead, I focus my letters on just a few relevant things that are going on. I think of my letters like a coffee catch up; I try to anticipate the things my recipient might ask if we were face-to-face and the areas of shared interest between us whether that's family, business, books, or ghosts we've met!

And here's the list of suggestions to get you writing.

* Book / TV or movie reviews.
  * yours or rewrite someone else's that you think the recipient might appreciate.
* A description of a gallery / museum / cafe or restaurant you visited.
* A recipe you love, or have adapted.
* Quotes or passages from a great book.
* Life lessons learned.
* A new hobby you've taken up.
* Things you're enjoying right now
  * albums, notebooks, pens
* Recaps: monthly or quarterly in reflection.

I can't wait to see what you have to write. Don't hesitate to share what you've written with me.
