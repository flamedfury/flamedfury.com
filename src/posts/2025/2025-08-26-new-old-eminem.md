What’s going on, Internet? [Everybody’s Looking At Me](https://musicthread.app/link/31ofMWAL2oangry6AcO4N3l728M), a new old track just dropped on the **STANS** documentary soundtrack.

If you ever paid attention during “[The Kiss](https://musicthread.app/link/31ofMVbpqKhUfZHVhTBy73lPBFp)” skit on _The Eminem Show_, you’ll recognize it. It’s the same track playing in the background on the car stereo.

People have been chasing this one for years. The verse showed up on a [Funk Flex freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNTSPw0Zh6k) with Proof (RIP), and there were rumours it was meant for [_The Wash_](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/13408-the-wash) soundtrack but got cut.

The timing lines up too. Em’s talking about the Grammys (The Real Slim Shady), mentioning NSYNC and Britney, and takes a shot at Limp Bizkit’s _Chocolate Starfish_ album (October 2000). That puts it post _Marshall Mathers LP_, pre _Eminem Show_.

This is peak early 2000s Em. Effortless lines, sharp wordplay, funky beat, and those layered vocals he nailed back then. He smokes the track without even trying. No lame dad jokes, no forced punchlines, no random words thrown in just to rhyme. Just Em in his bag, the way I remember him.

On the hook he flips [Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me”](https://musicthread.app/link/31oi4pIkr1BccD5hbKjD4XrHnDg). Makes me wonder if sample clearance is why it stayed locked up.

This is the Em I love. Vault tracks from this era? Sign me the hell up.
