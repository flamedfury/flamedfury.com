# Sicker Than The Remix

Description: Settling into our new life routines, open homes, new pages on the website and my favourite posts from around the web.

What's going on, Internet? This is the August recap, but without the usual title. Time to mix things up. I used to pull post titles from song lyrics, so here we go again.

August was busy for me and the family. We're still finding our feet in Auckland, but enjoying [Living Local](/posts/living-local/)  while staying with family. We checked out more open homes, still hoping we can find a place of our own without being an hour out.

Bandcamp came through with another Bandcamp Friday [where I had a huge cart to unload.Check out what I grabbed and let me know if you liked any of them.

We had two trips back home, which felt strange flying in instead of driving to our old place. The first weekend we stayed with a friend and then a hotel in townâ€”the first time since our wedding night. Our hotel was near [Slow Boat Records](https://slowboatrecords.co.nz/) , so I ducked in before lunch and scored [The 8 Mile Soundtrack](/recordshelf/eminem/8-mile/) and Wu-Tang's [Gravel Pit](/recordshelf/wu-tang-clan/gravel-pit/) single, which was a nice find since singles rarely show up.

The next weekend I went solo for [Beervana](https://beervana.co.nz/) and some golf with my mates. I squeezed in a couple of lessons before I left Auckland, but once I hit the course I forgot everything, naturally.

I also spent some time reflecting on the early 2000s and wrote about how [I Never Liked MySpace](/posts/i-never-liked-myspace/), instant messaging was always my jam.

Finally, I didnâ€™t end up watching the new *Stans* documentary, but I dove straight into the soundtrack. The highlight for me was a [New Old Eminem](/posts/new-old-eminem/) track pulled from the vault, early-2000s Em at his best, layered vocals and all... I'm hoping we get more of these unreleased gems from the vault soon.

## Reading

Not many books have been on my list lately, but I did pick up [Fahrenheit-182](/bookshelf/fahrenheit-182/) by Mark Hoppus and really enjoyed hearing his take on the Blink story. I also read [Young Jane Young](/bookshelf/young-jane-young/) by Gabrielle Zevin after loving *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow*, I grabbed this one too and it didnâ€™t disappoint.

## Music

As mentioned above, I picked up and added new new records to the collection:

-   [Eminem - 8 Mile](/recordshelf/eminem/8-mile/)
-   [Wu-Tang Clan - Gravel Pit](/recordshelf/wu-tang-clan/gravel-pit/)

## Gaming

Iâ€™ve finally got my new hybrid WFH/gaming setup underway. I used to have two separate spaces. One desk and monitor for work, another for gaming, but now Iâ€™m having to merge everything into a single shared setup. Itâ€™s been tricky since each monitor was tailored for its task, and running both computers on one screen has caused some compatibility headaches. For now Iâ€™m using the gaming monitor, but the plan is to sell both and upgrade to a single display with USB-C for work, DisplayPort for gaming, and at least 144 Hz plus of features of a modern display.

While I haven't been doing a lot of gaming I've managed to put in the bare minimum effort in Season 3 of The War Within and by week four I've already hit [The War Within Keystone Master: Season Three](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=41973/the-war-within-keystone-master-season-three) and [Ahead of the Curve: Dimensius, the All-Devouring](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=41624/ahead-of-the-curve-dimensius-the-all-devouring). I think this is our quickest clear for Ahead of the Curve.

## Bookmarks

I only managed three bookmarks this month, which feels pretty light. I was sure Iâ€™d shared more, but I guess that explains all the open tabs I still need to get through. Check back next month, and if you want more in the meantime, [dive into the archive](/bookmarks/).

- [Seeing A Different Web](https://mtwb.blog/posts/2025/tech/seeing-a-different-web/) Mattâ€™s post talks about how the return to the "small web" or "IndieWeb" has allowed new surfers to recapture the original sense of community  and direct interaction of the early days of the web, before social media and the five websites.
- [Warcraft 3: Rise of the Blood Elves â€“ A Steam Deck Review](https://dadwithadeck.com/2025/06/25/warcraft-3-rise-of-the-blood-elves-a-steam-deck-review/) I definitely want to play this campaign after reading the post, not sure if I'd be able to play it on the Steam Deck though!
- [Why I Blog](https://orbitalmartian.vercel.app/blog/2025-07-29-why-i-blog/) OrbitalMartian shares why they blog. So, why do you blog.

## Website

Iâ€™ve been playing with the site again. Early in the month I rolled out a new [homepage layout](/) that leans more into the bento grid style while displaying more meta information like we would in the early 2000s.

By the end of the month I pushed some bigger under-the-hood changes. Image processing has been optimised, which cut down build times dramatically, it's down to under three minutes again.

I've also fixed an issue with fetching the recently played Steam games so it now handles things properly when no recent games have been played. They're not being displayed on the website any at the moment, but I'm working on surfacing that data on the [Gameshelf](/gameshelf/) which is still under major construction.

## Happening around the web

[Robb](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2025/) & [Adam](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2025/) are in full swing with their annual [robb Ã— omg.lol Relay for St. Jude](https://stjude.omg.lol/) fundraiser! Get amongst it.

Submissions have closed for the Autumn 2025 issue of [Good Internet Magazine](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/) which has [xandra](https://xandra.cc) busy getting the new issue ready. If you have the means, consider [signing up for a membership](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/mem/ ) and never miss out on a physical or digital issue!
