What's happening, Internet? I reckon Bandcamp Friday should be monthly. My cart piles up fast between events and I always end up making cuts to stay within my budget. I get why they can’t run it every month, but still…

Since the last BCF [back in March](/posts/new-music-friday-4/), I stacked my cart and had to drop a few pre-orders that’ll just roll over to next time. The artists will get my cash eventually, so no stress there.

Here’s the haul this round, local releases first, then a few international picks:

- [I Want To Rock And Roll](https://jazminemary.bandcamp.com/album/i-want-to-rock-and-roll) — Jazmine Mary. Local folk artist with a laid-back vibe; perfect Sunday afternoon listening. Check the video for [Memphis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGFRZ_5fYA).
- [Something Good Is Happening](https://voomnz.bandcamp.com/album/something-good-is-happening) — Voom. Their first proper release since the ’90s — a collection of tracks from home studios and sheds. It's okay.
- [PONO!](https://christoph-el-truento.bandcamp.com/album/no-warning) — MOKOMOKAI. Been waiting for this one. Their third studio release; _pono_ in Te Reo Māori means true, honest, sincere. Check the [cinematic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8GPtnokghY) with aerial shots of my new city. It's hard.
- [NO WARNING](https://averagerapband.bandcamp.com/album/stream-of-nonsenseness) — christoph el truento & brandn shiraz. First found Brandn Shiraz on MOKOMOKAI’s _WHAKAREHU_ [lead single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI4xGuLC7GI). Tough track. Bonus: a friend of my wife’s did the cover art.
- [Stream Of Nonsenseness](https://averagerapband.bandcamp.com/album/stream-of-nonsenseness) — Average Rap Band. Needed this to complete my Tom Scott collection. Side project he ran out of Melbourne.
- [WAR](https://talimusic.bandcamp.com/track/war) — Tali, Y-Zer. New single from Tali. Instant buy.
- [Feast](https://danicabryant.bandcamp.com/album/feast) — Danica Bryant. Local pop artist trying to make it, catchy and fun.

And the international stack:
- [Wet Leg](https://wetleg.bandcamp.com/album/wet-leg) & [moisturizer](https://wetleg.bandcamp.com/album/moisturizer) — Wet Leg. Don’t remember where I first came across them, but glad I did. Both albums have been on repeat, and I’ve even spotted them in local record shops on the shelves.
- [Last Exit To Crooklyn](https://eddiekaine.bandcamp.com/album/last-exit-to-crooklyn) — Eddie Kaine. Latest collab with Big Ghost. Heavy.
