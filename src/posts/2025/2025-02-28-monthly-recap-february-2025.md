Whatâ€™s going on, Internet? Getting slammed by life, so here's my belated February update.

February was full of familiy acitivity and events leading up to our friends wedding.

We spent [Waitangi Day](https://www.waitangi.org.nz/whats-on/waitangi-day) at [Tauherenikau Waitangi Day Races](https://www.tauherenikau.co.nz/waitangi-racing/) as a pre-wedding event. Was a great day in the sun catching up with friends, enjoying some drinks and having a cheeky punt on the horses.

The following weekend we gathered at [Brew Town](https://www.brewtown.co.nz/) for the stag party. We had a big group, around fifteen of us to help celebrate the groom's last weekend before marriage. The weather was fantastic and we spent the morning and afternoon go karting, paintballing, drinking and eating before heading off to wrap up the evening playing pool.

The following weekend we headed out to the Wairapa and stayed in Martinborough again for teh weekend as the wedding was being held just out of â€ own at a lovely venue, Lacewood. We had a wonderful time again catching up with new and old friends and celebrating our friends marriage. It was a treat to leave the kids with their grand parents and for my wife and I to enjoy an afternoon and evening out without them.

## Blogging

- [Music Questions Challenge](/posts/music-questions-challenge/), A new blog challenge appears. Check out some of my musical favourites.
- [Blogging For The Hell Of It](/posts/blogging-for-the-hell-of-it/), Why can't I bring myself to just writting about nothing in particular?
- [Keeping A Reading Log](/posts/keeping-a-reading-log/), Keeping a physical log has been a nice spark of joy for me so far this year.
- [Let Me Solo Him](/posts/let-me-solo-him/), Possibly the most difficult thing I've ever completed in this game.

## Reading

- [Rose/House](/bookshelf/rose/house/) by Arkady Martine. A short read, that was okay. Wouldn't bother reading it again.
- [Madam](/bookshelf/madam/) by Antonia Murphy. This was a great read. A written account of the author's experience establishing and running of an ethical brothel in Aotearoa's far north. I'd previously watched the [TV adaptation](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/256720-madam) and enjoyed it.
- [Livesuit](/bookshelf/livesuit/) by James S. A. Corey. A novella based in the new "Captive's War" universe. While the main story "The Mercy of Gods" was centered around a group of abducted scientists, this story revolves around the soldiers who are left to fight the alien invaders. Fantastic read.
- [Malibu Rising](/bookshelf/malibu-rising/) by Taylor Jenkins Reid. My second book by this author that I couldn't put down. Loved the characters and the way the story unfolded alternating between the two timelines until reaching the conclusion.
- [Fourth Wing](/bookshelf/fourth-wing/) by Rebecca Yarros. Fantastic read. I saw a lot of chatter about the latest book, Onyx Storm and was told to start at the beginning. Glad I did.

## Music

A close friend came to stay with us and they brought me a copy of Kendrick Lamar's [GNX](/recordshelf/#gnx) to add to the record collection!

## Gaming

I got right back into World Of Warcraft in preperation of Season 2 starting.

My goals for season 2 are:
- [Ahead of the Curve: Chrome King Gallywix](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=41298/ahead-of-the-curve-chrome-king-gallywix)
- [The War Within Keystone Hero: Season Two](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40952/the-war-within-keystone-hero-season-two#)
- [Let Me Solo Him: The Underpin](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=41210/let-me-solo-him-the-underpin)

Season 2 doesn't seem like it's going to be a super long season which is fine by me. Realistically, all other gaming intentions are on hold.

## Website

I've not managed to keep the [changelog](/changelog) updated through February! But there's been nothing major to make note of either. I've played around with a few of the site colours and caught up with some upstream changes from Eleventy Excellent.

## Happening around the web

I've not been online enough to know what's been going on around the web recently. However, I do know that submissions are now closed for the first issue of [Good Internet Magazine](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/). [Xandra](https://xandra.cc/) is busy putting the pages together ready for a May release!

Aight, sweet. Catch you up, laterz ðŸ‘‹
