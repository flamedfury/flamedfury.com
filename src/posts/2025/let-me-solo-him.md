What's going on, Internet? Last night just as the servers went down before the patch 11.1.0 updates were made I managed to kill Zekvir ?? and complete the achievements [Hunting The Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40431/hunting-the-hunter) and [Let Me Solo Him: Zekvir](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40433/let-me-solo-him-zekvir), both which required to kill Zekvir on Tier ?? before the end of Season 1.

I managed to compelte this about thirty minutes before Season 1 finished.

This has been the most difficult activity I've completed so far in this game across the last nineteen years. That's including the original [Rhok'delar](https://www.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers) questline back in the original game.

The kill took me around one hundred pulls, where each pull lasted between three to five minutes each. As a Marksmanship Hunter I found it difficult to keep damage up on the must kill add when having to dodge the many mechanics, especially near the end of the second phase where they seemed to overalp each other. It got hectic.

After a few close calls of 12-8% I felt like I wasn't going to make it, but finally, adrenaline pumping I got the kill.

That'll teach me for leaving something like this to the literal last minute.
