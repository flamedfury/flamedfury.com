What's going on, Internet? This past Thursday, Angus (my dog) and I headed to my parents' place in the Wairarapa to stay the night. I dropped Angus off before continuing to Greytown to attend "The Magic Of Writing It Down," an in-person workshop on journaling.

Millie Blackwell of [The Village Bookshop](https://www.mrsblackwell.com/) hosted the workshop, which was run by [Dan Keane](https://www.american.nz/). It took place upstairs above [Blackwell and Sons](https://blackwellandsons.nz/) in the distillery tasting room.

There were eight other people besides myself. I was the youngest by several years, but that was all good. It was nice being the youngest again.

We started the workshop with a writing exercise. The prompt was

>  "Life is weather. Life is meals"
>
> â€‹	- James salter

After five or ten minutes of silent writing, we focused on three selected journal entries from three people.

- [William Colenso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colenso) (NZ, 1811-1899)
- [Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf) (UK, 1882-1941)
- [John Cheever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cheever) (US, 1912-1982)

We read and discussed each entry. I liked John Cheever's writing style the most. He wrote exactly the way I want to write: descriptive without being wordy, with lots of nouns and fewer adjectives.

We wrapped up with another writing exercise. Either write something new or finish what you started earlier. I chose to finish what I started. I'll share what I wrote another day.

I had a fantastic time at the workshop and am glad I went. I don't usually leave the house on school nights, and I look forward to attending similar events in the future.

I've started writing a small recount of my day every other day in a journal. I'll eventually share some here, just like this one.
