I just read [Blogging just because](https://folkmoss.bearblog.dev/blogging-just-because/) by Folkmoss and loved it. I relate to it in so many ways.

> Finishing up a long day of work only to plop down on the couch and turn on a slightly larger screen for entertainment is the real adversary. My brain needs rest, but not this kind. ……… The best form of relaxation isn't consumption, it's creation.

Especially this, even if not in the same context as Folkmoss wrote. After a day of work, the kids, by the time I do get a moment to myself I'm not in a state of mind to sit down and type out my thoughts as much as I want to.

I think of all sorts of things that happen day to day that I want to post about, like where she says "Blogging just because is cathartic."  at the top of the post.

Thinking back to the pandemic where Folkmoss, like many people, experienced the crushing weight of what was going on, I did manage to [post regularly](/tags/covid-19/). This was when I started working on fLaMEd fury again after a many year hiatus.

I really want to get back into that type of posting!

I suppose I did manage to do this during [WeblogPoMo2024](tags/weblogpomo2024/) last year, but that took a lot of effort...

I agree that working on the website itself, surfing other websites is relaxing in its own way, I often find myself doing these activities to distract myself from actually sitting down and unloading my thoughts and finishing one of the dozens of drafts I started.

But you know what? Maybe it's time to change that. Blogging for the hell of it is exactly what I need. No pressure, no expectations, just me and my thoughts. Who knows? Maybe someone out there will find it interesting or relatable.

I've got all these half-finished drafts sitting around, collecting pixel dust. Why not just finish one? It doesn't have to be perfect. Hell, it doesn't even have to make sense to anyone but me. The point is to write, and get those thoughts out of my head and onto the screen.

Will setting aside fifteen minutes a day be enough? Recent blog posts have taken over an hour to draft up and right, including the little research I put into them. If I'm getting into the habit of jotting down the thoughts of the day about nothing in particular, maybe fifteen minutes a day is enough.

I love how people like [Lou](https://louplummer.lol/blog/), [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/), [Annie](https://anniemueller.com/), [Ava](https://blog.avas.space/), approach this.

What I want to do is write. No worrying about who's reading or what they think. Just me, my thoughts, and the web.
