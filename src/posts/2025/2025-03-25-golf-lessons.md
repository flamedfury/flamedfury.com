What's going on, Internet? I had my second golf lesson this past Friday.

I met Brady, my coach, at Maor Park Golf Sanctuary. It's a beautiful place. I never thought much of it while driving past it hundreds of times over the years. It's nicely tucked away between the highway and Te Awa Kairangi.

The driving range is a bring-your-own-ball lawn range, which is very cool. Hitting the ball off the grass is a different experience than hitting the ball off a range mat.

For my second lesson, we recapped my iron setup and swing from my previous lesson before trying the same with a driver. The setup positioning felt awkward, and hitting the ball "correctly" proved difficult. It was satisfying when I did manage to hit the ball correctly. I love it when my coach calls out, "Now that's a golf shot." after those shots.

I'm picking up a set of clubs soon. My progress will be much better with my own set. Consistency is key. I've signed up for a four week intermediate course with my coach starting in April. I'm looking forward to learning some short range and course management.
