What's going on, Internet? One of the absolute best things about moving up north and where we are currently staying with family is the location. We're not in the central city, which is absolutely fine by me. However, we're only a 10 minute drive away, which is super convenient.

We're a five minute walk from the village shops, which is perfect for me as a 100% remote worker. Being near the village is fantastic for my mental wellbeing. It encourages me to step away from the work computer and go for a walk.

In just four weeks, I've already felt a sense of belonging in our new village. The local shopkeepers give me nods, my barber across the road gives me a wave, and other villagers greet me as they go about their day. I've settled on one cafe to become my regular spot, where I'm always welcomed with a big, hearty hello.

We're spoilt for choice with the variety of shops and eateries down here. It's been great to collect the kids up on a Sunday morning after the gym and take them for a walk (the long way) to the village, stopping off at the cafe for hot chocolate and fluffies. Their mum appreciates an hour of kid-free time.

Our previous neighbourhood was definitely beautiful and had community, but it lacked the convenience we now enjoy. It was a place of quiet beauty, but our new location is a vibrant community where we're always just a short walk or drive away from everything we need.

Speaking of convenience, where we are now, we're just a 10-15 minute drive away from most places around the city. You just can't beat it.
