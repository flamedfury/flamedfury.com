What's happening, Internet? Writing this one a bit late as Bandcamp friday for March was back on the 7th.

I'd been adding albums and singles to my cart since last December just waiting for Bandcamp Friday to come around. As per usual I've focused on local artists, both new and old music.

[RESISTANCE](https://talimusic.bandcamp.com/album/resistance) by TALI is her latest album/EP featuring five new tracks produced by herself. Released as a celebration of the 20 year anniversary of her first single

[Bright Black(https://mysterywaitress.bandcamp.com/album/bright-black-night)] Night by Mystery Waitress. I found this while browsing other peoples lists and picked it up. Not bad after a couple listens.

[Revulva](https://regardingvulva.bandcamp.com/album/revulva) by Revulva. This is another that I found browsing other peoples lists. Loved it after listening during preparing dinner with the kids last Saturday evening.

[Better](https://sureboy.bandcamp.com/album/better-2) by Sure Boy. This album is one I know and love and has only just shown up on Bandcamp so I had to grab it here to replace my 192 Kbps MP3 version with a beautful FLAC version.

[Vita](https://daviddallas.bandcamp.com/album/vita) by David Dallas. This is David's latest album released last year. Amazing wordplay. I hope he finds what he's looking for with his music.

[Bazooka Kid](https://pncmusic.bandcamp.com/album/bazooka-kid), [Rookie Card](https://pncmusic.bandcamp.com/album/rookie-card), and [Man On Wire](https://pncmusic.bandcamp.com/album/man-on-wire) by PNC. Legendary NZ Hip Hop, collecting his back catalogue.

[Kaleidoscope](https://brookeduff.bandcamp.com/album/kaleidoscope) by Brook Duff. Brook Duff was signed to Illegal Musik in 2011 or 2012 and quickly released her first single "Till The End" in 2012. The album was later released in 2013. And we haven't heard anything from her since.

[Taste Test](https://homebrew.bandcamp.com/album/taste-test), [Summer Ale](https://homebrew.bandcamp.com/album/summer-ale), [Last Week](https://homebrew.bandcamp.com/album/last-week). and [Home Brew Light](https://homebrew.bandcamp.com/album/home-brew-light) by Home Brew. Filling in the back catalogue of all the music that Tom Scott released under Home Brew Crew, before they dropped the "Crew" and released their first LP, "Home Brew" in 2011. Last Week is my favourite out of the bunch, such a fantastic concept, great story telling. Reminds me of how I'd spend my time in my late teens and early twenties.

If you check out any of this music, let me know what you think. Until next time, laterz.
