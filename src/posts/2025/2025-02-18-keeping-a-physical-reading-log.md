What's going on, Internet? One thing that has brought me joy this year has been keeping a physical reading log. I already keep a digital log of the [books I read](/bookshelf/) on this website, but the [physical reading log](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/products/reading-log-series-3-passport-size) that I picked up last month during a visit to  [Mrs Blackwell's Village Bookshop](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/) has been a great addition to my reading journey.

These beautiful notebooks are made by the Blackwell's through their [Printing Press](https://blackwellpress.co.nz/).

The one I have is a series 3 passport size, and it has enough pages to record seventeen books. You can also get the reading log in a [regular size](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/products/reading-log-series-3). This reading log allows you to record:

- Title
- Author
- Date Started / Date Completed
- Number of Pages
- Format: Hardcover, Paperback, E-Reader or Audiobook
- Owned / Purchased From
- Borrowed / Return Date
- Your notes from the book
- Keywords / Concepts
- Star Rating

After finishing a book, I like to sit at my desk and record the book details and my thoughts. Then, I can put add them to my website as a [bookshelf entry](/bookshelf/the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue/).

This reading log has been designed to fit in the Traveller's Company leather case, which is [also available](https://villagebookshop.co.nz/collections/travellers-company/products/leather-notebook-s-brown) at the Village Bookshop. It looks like a great accessory to protect the many reading logs I hope to use over the years, and it seems like it will last forever.
