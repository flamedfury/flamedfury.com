What's going on, Internet? Video guides and tutorials are great for getting a quick overview of a process, but they're hard to go back to for reference. I know this has been said many times before, but now it's my turn.

As I prepare to rebuild my home media centre, I've been watching a few video guides in order to get an idea of what a good way to approach this in 2025 is.

There are many videos showing dozens of different approaches to managing the software stack, and they have been great for an overview and a walkthrough on how they've set up the apps. The problem I have is that videos are the worst format to use for reference.

If you're producing fantastic video content, please put in a bit more effort and provide a text version too. I'm sure many people will appreciate it.
