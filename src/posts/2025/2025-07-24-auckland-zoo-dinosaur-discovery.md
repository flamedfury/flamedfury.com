What's going on, Internet? Last week we caught up with my brother and his family and headed to Auckland Zoo to checked out the Dinosaur Discovery Track.

> This immersive educational experience in the Zoo’s former elephant habitat features 25 large-scale animatronic dinosaurs made by world-leading dinosaur creators, The Dinosaur Company.
>
> These spectacular replicas move and roar (some even spit water!) and represent the rich diversity of life from our planet’s intriguing Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods of the Mesozoic Era between 252 - 66 million years ago!

We went in the evening, so it was a late one for the kids, but it made the experience so much better with the fantastic lighting. The place with packed with other families and kids which made a chaotic evening but we survived.

We picked up pizza on the way and enjoyed a pizza picnic at the zoo before heading in. The kids enjoyed the silent disco at the end.

The dinosaurs themselves were pretty amazing, overall a fantastic evening out with the family.
