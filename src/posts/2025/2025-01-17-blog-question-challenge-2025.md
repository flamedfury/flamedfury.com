What's going on, Internet? The Blog Question Challenge has been an exciting meta blog challenge that's been doing the rounds the past couple weeks.

As far as I can tell it started over on [Ava's blog](https://blog.avas.space/) as the [Bear Blog Question Challenge](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/) but has evolved as everyone outside of the [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) and across the Fediverse and Indie Web community.

Nobody tagged me, but I'm going to jump in anyway. Peace.

## Why Did You Start Blogging In The First Place?

When I started Flamed Fury it wasn't exactly blogging. especially not in the way how blogs and posts are considered blogging today. The front page was used to share short updates about changes to the website or what we might have been up to today, short status updates. It was microblogging before microblogging.

## What Platform Are You Using To Manage Your Blog, And Why Do You Use It?

My website is my platform. The blog part of my website is a small part over the overal website. I use [11ty](https://11ty.dev/) to build and manage my website, and including a blog as part of it is super simple.

Before reviving Flamed Fury back in 2020 I was mucking around with a project in Hugo and ditched that pretty quickly after getting fustrated with the templating system. While surfing I came across 11ty being mentioned an awful lot, and after running through a couple tutorials I was hooked and have never looked back.

## Have You Blogged On Other Platforms Before?

Again, not so much platforms but software over the years, started out with flat file CMS scripts, [NewsPro](https://web.archive.org/web/20010509081826/http://www.amphibianweb.com/newspro/) (CGI), [Coranto](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209203157/http://coranto.gweilo.org/official/) (CGI) which replaced NewsPro, a pre-Google [Blogger](https://web.archive.org/web/20010202054500/http://ex.blogger.com/) (Web/FTP), which provided a web portal and a flat file that was FTPd to your webserver,  [CuteNews](https://web.archive.org/web/20030324220204/http://www.cutephp.com/) (PHP) which was a PHP version of NewsPro, and finally Greymatter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)) before Wordpress took over.

Flamed Fury was my home from 1999-2005 before I retired it and kicked around with a couple Wordpress sites on different domains right up until 2020 where I revived Flamed Fury and it morphed into what it is today five years later.

## How Do You Write Your Posts?

Either on the desktop or laptop, I write in [Typora](https://typora.io/), check spelling and grammar with [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org/), and paste into [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) where I spin up a new markdown file with some front matter and then the website is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) before being [pushed to my webserver](/posts/deploying-an-11ty-project-to-shared-hosting/).

## When Do You Feel Most Inspired To Write?

These days? On the rare occasion I get some time to myself. It's tough sometimes. Ideas for posts usually strike me while I'm doing something where I'm not in a position to act on the idea, walking the dog, driving the car, getting one of the kids to sleep. If I'm unable to get that idea out of my head and onto paper or a note then it's usually gone forever.

When I do have a moment and surfing the web, and read a nice post, I love to write a reply-to post. I love those.

## Do You Normally Publish Immediately After Writing, Or Do You Let It Simmer?

I like to publish immediately after writing. If I don't, it runs the risk of being delayed even further. Keep in mind that I might find a pocket of time to start a post, and then a spare moment here or there over the course of ten days before I actually finish a post.

Maybe I'd post more if I could get back into the habit of short posts. Posts that weren't trying to deep dive or dissect a particular topic.

## Whatâ€™s Your Favorite Post On Your Website?

Hands down [Sliding Away](/posts/sliding-away/). I'd been sitting on this attempt at an essay for a couple years with a vague idea of how I wanted it to look on my website, different from a standard post, but still a functional part of the site. It took me a while to sit down, focus and make the damn thing. I'd love to revisit this one again soon and fix up the writing. I'm sure there's more I could explore on the topic.

## Any Future Plans For the Website? Maybe a redesign, changing the tag system, etc.?

Hell yeah. It seems like a neverending list. I want to finish my grand plans for my homepage. There are so many missing links to pages that exist that need to be there. I want the homepage to be the homepage, the portal to the rest of the website. Provide you, my fellow web surfers a curated tour of Flamed Fury.

Yes! I do want to revamp the tag system. I have grand ideas of a set of core categories to replace the exist tag sprawl and then a new sprawl of tags to granuarly sort the posts and work for tagging when the posts are pushed to Mastodon.

I have feeds setup for each tag already, I want to expose them to visitors, but only after I get the new category and tagging system sorted.

I want to do more with my reading, listening, and watching data. [Cory's](https://coryd.dev/) a big inspiration for this, but I don't want to go off the deep end like he has :P

I want to move the website to a VPS and start playing around with Coolify to manage the build and deploy process. I've been putting this off for over a year now!

I'll stop there, I should get this on a roadmap page, right?
