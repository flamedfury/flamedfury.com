What's going on, Internet? While surfing through Ava's website I read her [Music Questions Challenge](https://blog.avas.space/music-questions-challenge/) and need to jump on this one myself.

Here we go.

## What are five of your favourite albums?

I love that this is specifically five of your favourite albums rather than your top five albums of all time as I'd have a hard time narrowing them down to five.

* [The Marshall Mathers LP](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjH0e7VlOZsKlSnXnpLB925k) dropped while I was at high school and I got my hands on it early. That didn't stop me from buying the album multiple times over the year. Such a pivitol time in my musical development.
* [Plastic Hearts](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjJZC71ijzPWNjrDzd65TOMd) by Miley Cyrus. When this album dropped it rocked my world. I wish we got more like this from her before she moved on musically. Her voice really shines here.
* [Skull & Bones](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjKZYols3kEnqRaRJAyo8WUU) by Cypress Hill. Not their best album or most popular album by any means but has huge [nostalgia factors](https://flamedfury.com/posts/nostalgia-music/) for me.
* [Liquid Swords](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjSSodckOyu5OG9FvlSKvgSb) by GZA. I got to see him perform in August 2011 on a Tuesday night. Work was not fun the next day. The setlist was [insane](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/gzagenius/2011/san-francisco-bath-house-wellington-new-zealand-5bd097a8.html).

## What are five of your favourite songs?

* [Slide Away](https://musicthread.app/link/2hECY12BaeHyGJEhkQ8KxfDPRoe) by Miley Cyrus is my absolute favourite song by Miley. I won't go into it now, but I did try to write about it last year. Check out [Sliding Away](https://flamedfury.com/posts/sliding-away/).
* [Nothing Breaks Like A Heart](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjSlKzobqplXSQe0ey5Zi5ve) by Mark Ronson feat. Miley Cyrus was the opening track for her set at Glastonbury 2019 which I got to see live along with my wife, brother, and sister in law. It was an emotional day for me.
* [Rock Da Spot](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjRf3urgy4cW07nYXgjFjL9v) by RR Fierce & DMF is a banger of a hard dance track that was my absolute favourite during my rave days. The first time I heard this song on the dance floor in the middle of the night at the Phoenix Club, I melted. This remains on of my prized pieces of vinyl.
* [I Want To Know What Love Is](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjRK0z53lUqFhJEI571Stz3V) by Foreigner is one of those songs that I need to put on loud every now and then and (try to ) sing along to. It's really easy to get into the mood with this one.

## Favourite instrument(s)?

A pair of vinyl turn tables and a mixer.

## What song or album are you currently listening to?

Like right now? Nothing! I've got a movie paused while I smash this post out. However, the album I was listening to earlier today was [The Liberation Ofâ€¦](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjIBx5spJTaMq3biTJBmmUe5) by Ladi6, give it a listen, or at least check out [Like Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMfGodc7rzA), it's a banger.

## Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?

Not any more, there's not really an appropriate time these days. If I did I'd be listening to [Radio Active](https://www.radioactive.fm/), [95bFM](https://95bfm.com/), or [George FM](https://www.rova.nz/radio/george-fm). I suppose I do listen to Radio New Zealand for the news bulletins if that counts?

## How often do you listen to music?

Almost every day.

## How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?

All the time. I keep up with a few local websites and playlists for local music and keep an eye on a few subreddits for international music. I've also picked up a few new artists and albums to listen to by surfing the independent web.

## What's a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?

Definitely [Home Brew](https://musicthread.app/link/2gMYjxZvLxL9Fb96j28wvRF68RE) by Home Brew. Tom Scott is a legend on the mic and one of the greatest MCs to come out of Aotearoa. I wish this had even more regocintion locally and across the world.

## What's your favourite song of all time?

Yo, this one is super hard. [Gangster's Paradise](https://musicthread.app/link/2sTkjQtZ0kOen3OILuqhrMHMd0I) by Coolio is going to be up there when this conversation comes up.

## Has your taste in music evolved over the years?

Without a doubt. My musical taste started off with what my parents listened to and evolved from there. I'm always open to new music and can get into almost anything when hearing it performed live.

This wouldn't be a blog challenge without tagging someone else right? For this set of questions I want to hear from [Cory](https://coryd.dev/) and [Jcrabapple](https://cool-as-heck.blog/) as I know they're both big into music.
