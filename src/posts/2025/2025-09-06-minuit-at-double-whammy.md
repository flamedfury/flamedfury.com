What’s going on, Internet? Last night after the kids went to bed, my wife, her sister and I finally got out of the house — caught up with some friends and hit a gig.

We grabbed dinner from [The White Lady](https://thewhitelady.co.nz/) (an Auckland institution, apparently) and then headed down to Double Whammy to catch Minuit’s final show of their mini-reunion tour.

The gig was fantastic. My wife was surprised at the age of the crowd (our age +), but I had to remind her Minuit kicked off more than twenty years ago and haven’t released anything in over a decade.

The 13th Floor has a [great writeup](https://13thfloor.co.nz/minuit-double-whammy-sept-5-2025-13th-floor-concert-review/) of the gig.

Good music, good friends, good night. That’s all you need.
