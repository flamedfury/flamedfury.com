What's going on, Internet? What do you know, August is halfway through so I figure I better catch you two up with what I've been up to,

As of today, I'm six weeks into living in Auckland while the rest of my family are settling into their third month. We've been keeping busy with keeping the kids busy like visiting the [dinosaurs at Auckland Zoo](/posts/dinosaur-discovery-at-auckland-zoo/), and heading over to the North Shore to see [Hairy Maclary brought to life](/posts/hairy-maclarys-greatest-hits/) with the backing of the Auckland Philharmonia.

I've settled back into gym life at my new gym and have been smashing my 5 am wake ups to get my exercise out of the way before the kids wake up. I like my new gym, it's more equipped than the [temporary gym back in the Hutt], but still missing my favourite [Hamer Strength plate loaded machines](https://lifefitness.co.nz/products/hammer-strength/plate-loaded/). As it's a Les Mills, they have my favourite cycle classes, [RPM](https://www.lesmills.com/workouts/fitness-classes/rpm/) and [Sprint](https://www.lesmills.com/workouts/high-intensity-interval-training/les-mills-sprint/). It feels so good to be doing these again in person after five years of doing them in my garage on demand.

My wife and I have been checking out heaps of open homes and getting a feel for where we might like to settle. I really like the late 90s, early 2000s style house (suprise suprise) but these types of houses are out of the question due to the [building standards of the era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_homes_crisis). As I've been walking around these houses I've been thinking about what [millennial bangers](/posts/missing-you-like-candy/) I'd be playing loud on the speakers on a sunny Saturday morning.

I've got a couple trips back down to Wellington over the next couple weeks, check back later for recaps of my adventures back home.

## Reading

I took a break from Audio books recently while I adjusted to my new routines in Auckland, however on the drive up I got through [Annie Bot](/bookshelf/annie-bot/) by Sierra Greer that I really enjoyed.

## Music

I didn't pick up any new records this month but I am looking forward to exploring the record stores up here. Hoping for some good finds in the second hand shelves.

## Gaming

My PC was packed up while we organised our living space at our temporary accomodations and my Steam Deck was left in the Hutt so I've done no gaming. I missed out on the Collector's Bounty event in Warcraft. I've since got the PC set up and ready for The War Within Season 3! Let's Go!

## Website

I dived into the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/) and sorted the dates for individual records on the . For re-releases and re-issues the page will show the original release year, and the re-issue date. This had been bugging me since I updated the Recordshelf back in Easter.

In a rare moment of intense focus I sat down and hacked my way to finally creating the [Beer Fridge](http://localhost:8080/beerfridge) to collect my beer history from the past twelve years. I might write up how I did it later but the TLDR is a manual export from [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) and using 11ty to process and create the pages.

## Happening around the web

Honestly, I can't remember, I wasn't super online but I'm sure there was something awesome going on, why don't you let me know?


Sweeet, catch you up, laterz ðŸ‘‹
