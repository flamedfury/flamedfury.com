What’s going on, Internet? Just [last month](/posts/new-music-friday-5/) I was saying I wish Bandcamp Fridays happened more often and here we are again.

Of course, I had to grab Minuit’s backlog, especially after [last night’s gig](/posts/minuit-at-double-whammy/) While I was there, I also picked up some Fur Patrol, both incredible local NZ bands that still hit hard.

Minuit:
- [Last Night You Saw This Band](https://minuit.bandcamp.com/album/last-night-you-saw-this-band)
- [Dance Music Will Tear Us Apart, Again](https://minuit.bandcamp.com/album/dance-music-will-tear-us-apart-again)
- [Find Me Before I Die A Lonely Death.com ](https://minuit.bandcamp.com/album/find-me-before-i-die-a-lonely-death-com)
- [The Guards Themselves](https://minuit.bandcamp.com/album/the-guards-themselves)
- [The 88](https://minuit.bandcamp.com/album/the-88)

Fur Patrol:
- [Pet](https://furpatrol.bandcamp.com/album/pet)
- [Starlifter](https://furpatrol.bandcamp.com/album/starlifter)
- [The Long Distance Runner EP](https://furpatrol.bandcamp.com/album/the-long-distance-runner-ep)
- [Local Kid](https://furpatrol.bandcamp.com/album/local-kid)

If you missed out this month, don’t worry. The next Bandcamp Friday is October 3, 2025. Support your favourites, dig through the back catalogues, and grab something new and let me know!
