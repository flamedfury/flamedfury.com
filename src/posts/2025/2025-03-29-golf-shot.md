What's going on, Internet? I picked up a set of golf clubs this morning. I'm ready for my four week course that starts next Saturday.

While hitting some balls in the simulation room at the pro shop, I hit golf shot after golf shot.
As soon as I hit the range for the first fifty balls, I forgot what I was doing. I will need to work on my swing if I'm going to do any good over the next four weeks.

I've got six one-hour swing lessons available as part of buying the clubs, so I'm going to take advantage of those. The times are awkwardly on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, right around kid pickup and dinner times. We'll make it work, though, as they'll help me progress my swing.
