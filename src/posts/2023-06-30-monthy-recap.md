Hello web surfers, and welcome to June's recap. We're already 13 days into July; time flies...

I wrote four posts:
- [Adding game cover art to my /now page](/posts/adding-game-cover-art-to-my--now-page/) that describes how I took a simple unordered list of my recently played games into a grid that features beautiful cover art and a link to the game's store page using a combination of eleventy-fetch and the Steam API. 
- [Dragonflight Season Two Recap](/posts/dragonflight-season-two-recap/) that explores the achievements and goals I hit during World of Warcraft: Dragonflights second season.
- [Synology DS923](/posts/synology-ds923/) where I take a quick look at my new Synology DS923+ NAS and why I purchased it.
- [Network link aggregation on Synology and Unifi](/posts/network-link-aggregation-on-synology-and-unifi/) where I share notes from creating a bonded network link between my Unifi switch and Synology NAS to refer to at a later date or help anyone who is looking to do the same. 

I spent some time fixing up the [Seasonal Post](/tags/seasonal/) template just in time for the automatically generated [Autumn 2023 post](/posts/2023-autumn/). It looks a lot better than the first iteration.

Two new vinyls were added to the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/) collection; Britney's [Greatest Hits: My Prerogative](https://flamedfury.com/recordshelf/#greatest-hits:-my-prerogative) and The GZA's solo debut [Liquid Swords](/recordshelf/#liquid-swords). I was stoked to pick up Liquid Swords as this is my favourite solo Wu album.

I spent a bit of time looking into the [RaiderIO API](https://raider.io/api) to add to my [/now](/now/) page and keep my Warcraft progress automatically updated. I've encountered a problem where I can fetch my character data with Eleventy-fetch, but I cannot call or render the data in my Nunjucks loops. I'll spend more time on this during July and hopefully get that out the door soon.
