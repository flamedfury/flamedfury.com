**Alert Level**: Three
**Day**: 49

So I just finished up [season 3 of Ozark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozark_(TV_series)). Damn what an ending, I was not expecting that.

Calling this show intense is an understatement.

I guess this means there's definitely going to be a season 4 right? 

Can't wait.
