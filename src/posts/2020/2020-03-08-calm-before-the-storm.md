Yet another week flies by as if it was nothing.

The main highlights was visiting the markets. Saturday we got up early (not as early as during the week) to walk the dogs and head down to the riverbank markets where we collect our vegetables, milk, eggs, bread for the week and a pastry to go with my coffee later on. 

This is what I absolutely love about the weekend. 

What else happened this week?
