**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 7

Sun was out today, hung washing on the line. It wasn't warm enough so had to finish off in the dryer. Disappointing. 

In other news, comics to be specific, Marvel Comics will not be releasing any new comics, physically or digitally this week and in the future. Diamond Comic Distributors who have the monopoly on the distribution of single-issue comics to local comic book stores across the world has suspended distribution. In response Marvel will not be releasing new titles, even digitally. Which doesn't make sense to me as it seems like the perfect opportunity for digital to shine?

Oh well, I guess they know what they're doing. So many unfinished stories though.

This is just one of the minor effects across the world thanks to Covid-19.

I've added a [contact form to the contact page](/contact/) if you feel the need to get in touch.

Stay safe, stay strong.
