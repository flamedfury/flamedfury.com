**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 17

It's been a pretty chill day up here for us. The wind was out and that kept people indoors giving us some distraction-free :poodle: walks around the neighbourhood. 

The only news media I read today was from Radio New Zealand: [Another drop in new confirmed and probable cases](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/414073/covid-19-another-drop-in-new-confirmed-and-probable-cases).

No new deaths, more recoveries, but expecting more deaths in the days to come.

It's semi re-assuring that while the world seems to be getting worse, here in New Zealand we are in a pretty good position.

We enjoyed some homemade hot cross buns this afternoon. These were made with chocolate chips rather than raisins. They were :100: times better than traditional hot cross buns and I did not restrain myself from enjoying

Have spent several hours behind the scenes tweaking the website, started many drafts to help get my writing :writing_hand: buzz on.

Looking forward to dinner. 

Take care, stay safe.
