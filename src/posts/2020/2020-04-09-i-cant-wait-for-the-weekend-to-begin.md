**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 15

Yo, it's the last day of work for the week and we're in for a 4 day weekend.

Got up early this morning and we walked the poodles minutes before it started pouring with rain.

There is nothing worse than wet or house bound poodles.

I managed to get myself back into a better mental state. This week was very draining work wise. Got the tasks that needed to be done, pushed out to both the team and our customers. 

Satisfaction. (There's a great story why that's significant to me)

So, once it stopped raining the temperature stayed cool. We had a great 3km walk with the poodles at midday without any other dogs being walked. Very satisfying. We did encounter some dogs that were out in their front yards but we manged little commotion. 

Wrapped up work, got stuck in a little bit of layout improvements. Talking about layouts, making layouts, tweaking layouts takes me back to 2000. Hah. Anyway, we now have blockquote styling!

>“Cause sometimes, you just feel tired. Feel weak. And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you. You gotta find that inner strength, and just pull that shit out of you. And get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter.” – **Eminem**
