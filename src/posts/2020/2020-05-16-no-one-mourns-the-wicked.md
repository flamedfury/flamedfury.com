No One Mourns The Wicked [dropped yesterday](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/album/no-one-mourns-the-wicked).

This is the second time that [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_the_Machine) and [Big Ghost](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/) have linked up and dropped :fire:, the first being [Griselda Ghost](https://bigghostlimited.bandcamp.com/album/griselda-ghost) alongside [Westside Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westside_Gunn).

Griselda Ghost was my first introduction to [Griselda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griselda_Records) after being a long time follower of Big Ghosts' [hilarious writings on the Internet](https://bigghostlimited.com/big-ghost-presents-the-take-care-review/). Big Ghost started out parodying [Ghostface Killah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostface_Killah).

Time flies.

I managed to get up early this morning and secure myself a copy of the vinyl. These releases sell out super quick and the only one I have managed to get for myself previously was [The Plugs I Met](https://derapwinkelrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-plugs-i-met) by the third Griselda crew member, [Benny the Butcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_The_Butcher).

Anyway, this album is sweet. Short and sweet. Big Ghost brings the noise on the instrumentals and Conway is in his bag! I've managed a few listens and will continue over the weekend.
