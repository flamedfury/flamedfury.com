Sat down last week with my brother and watched season 1 of Halt and Catch Fire over a few days. 

Lots of drama, I would say, overly dramatic. I'm not even sure that I like any of the characters, except maybe Yo-Yo. 

I really like the story and all that but the characters are just so extreme :joy:. Like, they are just over the top irrational. They fly off the handle at the slightest anything!

The story is pretty cool and I can relate in a lot of areas and love what Joe has set out to achieve. Maybe not quite how he has gone about it.

It took a while to get used to that a lot happened off-camera and I had a few moments where I thought that I had missed a moment or an entire episode. I suppose it's alright once I figured that out.

We both started watching season 2 together before he headed back up north, and we are continuing to watch together and texting each other while watching to keep the conversation going. Can't wait to see how they progress with Mutiny.
