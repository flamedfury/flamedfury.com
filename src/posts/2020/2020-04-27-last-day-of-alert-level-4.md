**Alert Level**: Four 
**Day**: 32

Today marks the last day of living under alert level 4. Tomorrow we downgrade to alert level 3, which is much the same as alert level 4 but with a few more businesses being able to operate contactless. 

Looking forward to supporting a friends take out joint. Not looking forward to the madness that consumes the nation as take out joints return to operation.

I experienced a bit of frustration this morning where I just felt tired about everything. Some meditation and thoughts of gratitude helped acknowledge those feelings and I carried on with the day. 

I managed to work out, eat and watch some TV. 

I wonder how mental states may change under alert level 3. Let's find out.
