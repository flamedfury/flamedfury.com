What a huge month for X-Men releases. 

Went a bit overboard on the Wovlerine variants. Some of those covers were just too cool not to pick up, Can't hurt to grab a couple of a #1 Wolverine book right?

Can't wait to read it when it hits digital, lol.

This month we see the first of Hickman's Giant-Size X-Men book, starting off with Jean Grey and Emma Frost!
