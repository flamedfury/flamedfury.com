I was vaguely aware that this game was being remastered. I didnâ€™t keep tabs on it at all. I was cruising through steam recently and saw it, remembered and had to buy it.

Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn was the first game I ever bought myself on CD-ROM.

I had to sell all my buildings and build as many troops as I could in a last-ditch effort to destroy the remaining buildings in the NOD base.

Got there in the end. 

The game, by todays standards has a slow pace to it. This seems fine for me as I have trouble keeping up with modern RTS or what RTS turned into, Dota, League etc.

I'm enjoying this game and can't wait to finish it for the first time ever!
