Bit of a miss with the pull list this month with comic book shops around the world unable to operate... 

I have a number of issues at my local store, and a few issues secured from other stores hopefully, time will tell...

Totally missed out putting the X-Men Fantastic Four run on my list so have had to track down the first two issues from Ebay, and then there was a problem with my foward shipping address. I know that #2 has arrived but #1 is lost in transit somewhere. Hopefully it eventually shows up, I wanna see what happens to Franklin!

This month also sees a number of new titles, Cable (the kid version) and Hellions and the second issue of Hickman's Giant-Size X-Men.

Getting Apri's issues will be interesting...
