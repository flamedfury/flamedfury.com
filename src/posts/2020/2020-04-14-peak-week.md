**Alert Level**: Four
**Day**: 19

Not much tonight. Easter holiday road death toll is officially zero! 

Covid though, up to 9. Condolances to those affected. More cases on the rise.

Government starting to think about what post alert level four looks like.

Tried a different supermarket this morning and got the rest of what we needed. Back to cooking inspired dinners, have the rest of the week planned.

Cities: Skylines time, take care, stay safe.
