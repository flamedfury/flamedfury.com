**Alert Level**: Three 
**Day**: 41

For the second day in a row, New Zealand has recorded no new cases or deaths related to Covid-19.

> "Having zero new cases of Covid-19 to report for a second day in a row is very encouraging and all New Zealanders should feel pleased with their efforts," Dr Bloomfield said.

Another week at Level 3 and we'll see if we can progress to  Level 2. 

I'll steer this weblog back in the direction I intended and calm down on Covid-19 related posts. 

Laters.
