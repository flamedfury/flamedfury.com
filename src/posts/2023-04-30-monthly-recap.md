Hello web surfers, and welcome to April's recap. This month I focused on automating more of Flamed Fury.

While on a break from World of Warcraft, waiting for patch 10.1 and season 2 to begin, I loaded some games onto my Steam Deck in an attempt to play them. Spoiler, I didn't get too much game time this month. You can check out what I loaded on [What's On My Steam Deck Autumn 2023](/posts/whats-on-my-steam-deck-autumn-2023/).

After some inspiration from the [11ty Discord Community](), I managed to create my [/now](/now/) page with a bunch of cool automated features to make it dynamic. Some were carried over from the last version of Flamed Fury, and some were new. I wrote about how I did it; check out [Building and Automating My Now Page](/posts/building-and-automating-my-now-page/).

Record Store Day happened across the world last weekend. While I didn't get to check out any of my local record stores, I picked up a record I've been after for a while from a local-ish store online. Check out [Record Store Day 2023](/posts/record-store-day-2023/).

Besides that, I've been working on my metadata library and considering integrating it with my [Collections](/collections/) page. Look out for that over May.
