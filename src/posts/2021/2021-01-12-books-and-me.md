I've always been a big reader. I quickly picked up books and could read at a level above my age. This really helped me immerse myself and get lost in the stories. I mostly enjoy fiction, sci-fi, and fantasy.

During my early school years, I remember loving the [Pizza Hut Book It!](https://www.bookitprogram.com/) program, which looks to be still active. How it worked was you would read a bunch of books, collect certificates and exchange these for personal pan pizzas at pizza hut, that was fantastic. This program has been running since 1984; wow!

The other program that got me excited about reading was the [Scholastic Book Club](https://www.scholastic.co.nz/schools/book-club/), which is also still running. I loved when the brochures would get handed out to us in class, and I couldn't wait to get home to decide what books I'd ask my parents to buy for me to read. Sometimes they would get them for me too.

## Impactful Books and Authors
I've read many books by many authors during my life. A lot I have read, enjoyed and forgotten. However, some stick to memory as they have impacted and shaped my taste in what I love to read.

The last decade or so since owning an e-reader and apps such as Goodreads and [Oku](https://oku.club) will help ensure I always remember an author or a book. However, if I forget, it won't take long to review my reading history and refresh myself. 

### The early years
My earliest memory of really getting into books was during school in the early nineties. The Deepwater trilogy by by [Ken Catran](https://www.read-nz.org/writer/catran-ken/), and the Seddon Street Gang trilogy by [Jack Lasenby](https://www.read-nz.org/writer/lasenby-jack/) stand out to me vividly as books I loved when I was young. I read them multiple times each.

### More recently

As I grew older and discovered the world of science fiction & fantasy, the following authors; [Raymond E. Feist](http://crydee.com/), [Peter F. Hamilton](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/peter-f-hamilton/1507), [James S.A. Corey](https://www.jamessacorey.com/) and, [George R.R. Martin](https://georgerrmartin.com/) quickly became my favourites. I've read as much of their works as possible. In the case of Feist and Hamilton, multiple times.

#### Raymond E. Feist
The book that stands out to me as the one that set off my recent love for the genre(s) is [Shards of a Broken Crown](http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/book-synopsis/shards-of-a-broken-crown) by Feist. I picked this one from my dad's bookshelf and wasted no time reading it front to back. I was immediately immersed in the story and couldn't put it down, but most of it didn't make sense. The Web was less expansive back then, but I was soon able to figure out that this was the fourth book in a series out of a more expansive twelve-book universe. It took little time to dive right into [Magician](http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/book-synopsis/magician). Thirty-odd books later, I was done with the world of [Midkemia](http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/book-series).

I was pleased that Feist didn't stop writing and have enjoyed the [Firemane Saga](http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/firemane/books). Looking forward to a re-read of this series soon.

#### Peter F. Hamiton
Hamilton is to science fiction what Feist is to fantasy for me. I started with Hamilton with [The Reality Dysfunction](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/peter-f-hamilton/the-reality-dysfunction/9781509868605), the first book in the Nights Dawn trilogy. So I was already off to a better start than I was with Feist. 
Dad had all three books on the bookshelf, so I hungrily devoured all three huge paper books, one after the other.
I read Nightsdawn long before [Pandora's Star](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/peter-f-hamilton/pandoras-star/9781509868575) was released and was hyped to be able to read all Hamilton's new books as they were released.
