[Record Store Day](https://recordstoreday.com/) 2023 has been and gone. I was unable to get into any of the local record stores in person on the day as we were busy with family stuff so I went online and managed to find the one album that I had my eye on, Return To The 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version. 

This release of Ol' Dirty Bastard's debuet release from 1996 features two picture disc vinyls and features remastered versions of the songs.

> The late Wu-Tang Clan icon’s debut solo album, Return To The 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version, was one of the most anticipated releases of 1996, and it didn’t disappoint: spin-off hits Brooklyn Zoo and Shimmy Shimmy Ya provided excellent showcases for what Rolling Stone called ODB’s “raspy, lisp-punctuated voice and half-sung, half-rapped style”. Return To The 36 Chambers cracked the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, and fans will to return to the album once more this Record Store Day, for an exclusive 2LP picture-disc pressing.

I've been slowly collecting each of the original Wu-Tang members' first solo records. This was an excellent opportunity to add Return To The 35 Chambers to my collection, as this is the first time I've seen a copy available locally. 

When this record has been re-released and available on overseas online stores, shipping costs push this out of being a justified purchase.
