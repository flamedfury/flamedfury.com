Today I've spent a couple of hours updating my [Vinyl Collection](/interests/recordshelf/vinyl-collection/) page to fit the new website design. I'm still determining whether I like having it directly under the [Recordshelf](/interests/recordshelf/) page, which is part of the [Interests](/interests/) section or whether it should move to a new area I have on the planning board. It made sense to live here with the old design. With the new design, maybe not.

This gets me thinking about information architecture... This makes an excellent point for having a personal website. It's easy for me to change anything whenever I feel like it. We'll see.

Similar to the other new and updated pages, I've added a few paragraphs on why I like vinyl as a medium for music. I hope this adds some personality to the page and that you (the web surfers) reading can relate as you browse the collection.
I've moved all the vinyl metadata to its own JSON file in the `_data` directory, and the `vinyl-collection` template renders it nice and tidily. 

Future plans: Take photos of my collection, including pictures of the covers, sleeves, vinyl and anything else that makes the record unique.
