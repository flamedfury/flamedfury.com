I have spent little time on the website this month, focusing on family and work. I have written several posts about various things I've been up to. I have enjoyed the process and look forward to writing more.

I have created a backlog task to restore all archived posts posted to Flamed Fury over the years. These posts will provide an exciting look into my growth over the decades.
