**music**: BTNH - Resserection
**mood**: Day 38

My HM600 assessment went more than excellent today. I am happily  satisfied that I passed it with ease. So all thats left for HM600 now is the practical on Friday at 1pm. Bring it on.

Have to get up  early and get to town tomorrow morning for my job interview. Hopefully I can land the job, so I can save up lots of cash for the [Big Day Out](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.bigdayout.co.nz/) and my trip to Brisbane.

Oh well, I am exhausted and am going to catch some sleep so I am not real tired tomorrow.
