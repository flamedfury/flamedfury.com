**mood**: Day 45

My car paint should be here in the next couple days. Fuck thats cool, now I just have to get cash together for the front bumper, and hopefully something like christmas will deliver sideskirts and endcaps :D one can only hope tho.

Had my last exam today as well. YAY. Huge celebration. In my pants..... not that I celebrated. One more assignment to hand in, which is already done, and that's me for the summer.

Doing a urine test tomorrow after we check out Miles Udy to see what's wrong with my gearbox, then off to look at some houses to move into with my friend. Summer's looking to be awesome so far if everything goes to plan....
