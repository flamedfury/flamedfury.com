**music**: Notorious BIG - Ready To Die
**mood**: Day 41

Weekend's here yayaya! At least I dont have to worry about any  assesments for tech today! Just muck around download some music and get  drunk!

I am probly gonna get drunk this afternoon and play the [Xbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.xbox.com/en-nz) but it sucks as [Stacy Jones Rugby League](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.gamesman.co.nz/product.php?id=1513) has been pushed back another month for release which totally sucks balls!

[All Blacks](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://allblacks.xtra.co.nz/home) are playing Aussie tonite for the Semi Finals in the [Rugby World Cup](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/RugbyWorldCup/) tonight at 10pm (New Zealand Time) and I have a distinct feeling that the All Blacks will take a win dominating over Aussie.

Tomorrow after PD i think that I will get more links up on the site and get some links to my [friends](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119054153/http://www.phusion.us/). sites etc.
