That I am not unfortunatly.

Easter Weekend was total madness. With Fevah on Thursday night, it absolutly went off! It was so much fun I didnt seem to make it home till Sunday. Crazy huh? woah. I put up the photos from Thursday night so yeh go look at them if you want. I didn't get as much as I wanted due to me being fully cut. But oh well.

I'm off to Brisbane tomorrow so yeh. Random huh? Have fun keep safe.
