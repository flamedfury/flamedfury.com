Now that I have sorted all this out, logically, content comes next. None of the links up the top work so, when I get to it:-

I will put up various photos from my journies. I have ones from New Years, Wonderland, and random weekends.

Girls will be my tribute to my favourite celebrities at the moment, including Eliza Dushku.

Links, I will list my favourite places to visit on the internet for you all to check out.

Maybe tomorrow, if I finish my IT6206 Database Design work then yes.
