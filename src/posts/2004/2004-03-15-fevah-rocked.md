A very busy past couple of days, with class and what not. Then Fevah on Friday night with Guest DJ Matt Clarke. Was flippin awesome, maybe that is why I am so tired today. Well, at least I made it to class today.

Now I am working on getting the photos all uploaded to fevah.co.nz. I would upload them here, but my database hasn't been setup yet unfortunatly. I have at least 140 photos from the event and will have most of them put up at the fevah website, and a few of the others here that won't be suitable for Fevah website.

Saturday night was also full of hijynx and drunken shinanigans, at least 60 or 70 photos from there ready to be uploaded as well.

I better get back to it, until then.
