Today I've added the [Buttonwall](/explore/buttonwall) page to the [Explore](/explore/) section. Like webrings, buttons, especially the 88x31 buttons, were a big part of Web discovery. For this page, rather than dumping dozens of buttons, I searched the depths of the Web for information on their origin, popularity and how they were used. 

Per current personal website trends, I have started populating my own wall of buttons linking to the websites of web surfers I know or admire.

I've dumped links to the websites and resources I  used to write the paragraphs. I'll look at organising them in the future.
