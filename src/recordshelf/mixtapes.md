As you can tell, I love music. I also love to create mixtapes and playlists. Below are a selection of my most thoughtout mixtapes and playlists. Give them a listen and let me know what you think.

### This is: Griselda Records

Aye yo, doot doot doot doot. They don't make them like this anymore. Griselda Records, the home of Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny the Butcher. Grisalda make the type of music that want you to go outside and ride your bike without a helmet. Salute to the kings of the underground.

Griselda had a huge run between 2018 and 2021 with dozens of releases and additions to their roster to compliment Gunn, Conway and Benny.

These are some of my favourite records from the group, including posse cuts, features and individual records.

### Mixtape: DMX

With DMX's passing in 2020 I sat down and put together a list of my favourite DMX records to listen to as I digested the news.

### Mixtape: Dipset vs The Lox

The most anticipated Versuz of 2020 where everybody thought that a Dipset victory was a sure thing. However, on the night, The Lox came in and slaughtered. These are my favourite records from both groups.

### Mixtape: The Game

The Game was at one point Dr Dre's protege and 50 Cent's antagonist, and forever carrying the West Coast on his back. A long career with a huge catelogue of music. This mixtape features my favourite album cuts and features.

### Mixtape: Miley Cyrus

It isn't a secret that [Miley](https://miley.flamedfury.com) is my favourite musician. From TV star, to music's wild child, in 2020, Miley hit her best self with the release of Plastic Hearts.

These are my favourite Miley records.
