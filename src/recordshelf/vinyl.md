Below is my record collection. I enjoy collecting this medium. The process of selecting a record from the collection and intentionally listening to it adds so much more than throwing on a selection of songs selected by an algorithm.

Record collection is displayed by record release date, not collected date. If I can determine collection dates for the older records in the collection, this may change.
