An 88x31 button is a small graphic image that is used to link to another website. The buttons are called 88x31 buttons because they are 88 pixels wide and 31 pixels tall. These buttons were commonly used in the early days of the web to promote websites and to help people navigate from one site to another.

The idea behind an 88x31 button is that it would be placed on a website, and when someone clicked on it, they would be taken to the website to which the button was linked. Website owners often used these buttons to promote their own sites or to link to other websites that they found interesting and valuable.

88x31 buttons were trendy in the late 1990s and early 2000s but have largely been replaced by other methods of linking to websites, such as text links and banner ads. However, they are still used by some websites as a way to provide a small, unobtrusive link to another site.

They were introduced by [Netscape](https://web.archive.org/web/19961026040131/http://www3.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/netscape_now_program.html), an early web browser, in the late 1990s. They quickly became popular with websites such as Geocities, a popular hosting service for personal websites that existed during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Geocities and similar services allowed users to create their own homepages and customise them with various features, including 88x31 buttons.

They have made a comeback in recent years thanks to personal homepage creators and communities like [Neocities](https://neocities.org) and the [Yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org).
