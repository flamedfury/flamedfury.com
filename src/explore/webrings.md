A web ring is a collection of websites that are linked together in a circular structure. Web rings were popular in the early days of the web, before search engines became as sophisticated as they are today. Web rings were used to help people find similar websites on a particular topic.

Here's how it works: A web ring consists of a group of websites that are all related in some way, such as having a common theme or topic. Each website in the web ring has a special link on it that allows the visitor to navigate to the next website in the ring. The visitor can continue to follow the links around the ring, visiting each website in turn, until they return to the starting point.

Web rings were created as a way for people to discover new websites on a particular topic, and for website owners to promote their sites to a wider audience. Web rings were particularly popular in the late 1990s, but have largely been replaced by search engines and social media as a way to discover new websites.
