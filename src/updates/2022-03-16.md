**16 Mar, 2022**: Thanks to some wonderful feedback from a member of the Yesterweb community, I've made a number of fixes to the [Creating A Static Site Using 11ty & Deploy to Neocities]({{ page | relative }}guides/11ty-homepage-neocities). If you have followed the guide previously and got stuck, try again and you should end up with what I intended now. 

Always happy to get feedback, [just reach out to me]({{ page | relative }}contact/).

Will start working on part 2 soon.
