**02 Feb, 2022**: Minor site updates today, have added a couple more buttons to the sidebar [Fairytrash](https://fairytrash.neocities.org) and [Cabbage](https://cabbagesorter.neocities.org/). Made some additions to my [Web Manifesto]({{ page | relative }}manifesto/) along with a couple new links. I've also joined the [Retronaut Webring](https://webring.dinhe.net/).
