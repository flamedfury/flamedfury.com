**15 September, 2022**: I backtracked my last updated and moved my Gaming PC History to its own page, [Gaming PC History]({{ page | relative }}computerhistory/). 
Like most of my best ideas, this happened while deep in thought while walking the dogs. 

This has also given me thought to how I would like to re-organise my growing collection of pages into their own writing section. This would mean an update to my navigation.

Anyway, there's always something to work on, don't forget to sign [my guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com).
