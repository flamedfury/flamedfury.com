**12 September, 2022**: ~~I've made an update to the [Gameshelf]({{ page | relative }}gameshelf/)~~ **edit** I've created a new page that details my [Gaming PC History]({{ page | relative }}computerhistory/). I've sat down and taken a trip down memory lane, recollecting all the PCs I've built over the years. 

Writing this page took longer than I thought, but it has been a fun exercise.

I wish I had records of our PCs between 1996 and 2005. I think we had 1-2 family PCs before I  made enough money from website ads around 2000, and I could afford to buy PCs for myself. 

Anyway, the page is long now. I will look at dividing the sections into individual pages later this week. 

Give the page a read and let me know what the first PC you remember building was in [my guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com).
