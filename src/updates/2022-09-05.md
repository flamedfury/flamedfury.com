**05 September, 2022**: Yesterday was father's day down this side of the world. I spent the day with the family doing various activities. I was excited to receive a new pair of Air Force 1 shoes, the first pair of shoes I've got since the pre-COVID days.

The day's highlight was in the afternoon. I got to sit in the lounge to enjoy a couple of [big beers](https://garageproject.co.nz) and listen to two [records]({{ page | relative }}recordshelf/vinyl/) end-to-end. I don't get to do that often.
While having a rare streak of time to do stuff, I also managed to sit down and fix the [guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com/) so that it matches the updates to the homepage styles I've made over the months.

If you have a moment spare, head over and [sign it](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com/) and let me know what you think.
