**01 July, 2022**: Hey, have been doing & dealing with a number of things away from fLaMEd fury recently. The days fly by. Have made some minor changes. Have plans to revamp the front page along with the CSS backend. I will be keeping the graphics and colours. Noticed that the API used for the bookshelf has changed again, will need to take a look to fix that. <a href="https://scenequeen.neocities.org/">Scenequeen</a> has kindly made a new link button, check it out to the left.
