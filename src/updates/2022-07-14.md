**14 July, 2022**: That took a bit longer than I anticipated but I'm happy with the final result. Might not be noticible but have tweaked fonts, font sizes, spacing and managed to handle both base and page template layouts in the single css file. The base template uses a grid layout and the page template uses a flex layout, all the same html elements.

The new navigation doesn't use javascript, and works on all pages, but there are some issues on the page layout where the breadcrumbs are 3 links deep where they cover the hamburger on smaller screens.

Other than that I don't expect to make any major changes until the new year where I'm hoping to get a new design done!
