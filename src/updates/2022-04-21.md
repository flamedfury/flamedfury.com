**21 Apr, 2022**: Quick update that I have updated my subpage layout. The new layout removes the sidebar, including the menu and link buttons. I have included a breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page to let you know where you are within my homepage, with links back to the parent page(s). 

The other new feature is a fluid typescale for my heading elements. This allows the font-size to scale based on the window size. Should look good across desktop, tablet, mobile views.

I'll start working on applying my new stylesheet to the index page, which will keep it's current layout, with some minor style tweaks.

Let me know what you [think]({{ page | relative }}contact/).
