**19 July, 2022**: It's been easy to not run out of stuff away from the computer lately.

I've updated the [Vinyl Collection]({{ page | relative }}recordshelf/vinyl/) page to add new new records that arrived today, both Czarface. Czarface debut album from 2013 and Czarface, MF Doom â€“ Super What? which released 2021. Looks like I'm up to 30 in the collection now, wow!

I still have a to-do list item to take a photo of each record and stop hotlinking discogs, lol.

I think that I've managed to fix the API calls on the [Bookshelf]({{ page | relative }}bookshelf/) page from [Oku](https://oku.club). Added currently reading, and want to read sections as they were avialable as part of the API.
