I've always been into computer games and have played them for as long as I can remember in one way or another.

When I was very young we had a commodore 64 and a selection of games on floppy disk and a couple on cartridge. I remember all of the games that we had being very hard.

I enjoyed when we went over to friends places and they had either Amigas or IBM compatibles.

My first console was a Sega Master System 2. We never got a Mega Drive and missed everything in between and wound up with a Playstation at some point. We moved onto an Xbox and didn't have a console again until the Playstation 3 so that i could play Grand Theft Auto 4.

Outside of those, some of my best memories of gaming was on a PC. When we first got a PC, a kid on our block loaded up a bunch of games, Dune 2, Simcity 2000. The first two games we got on CD-Rom were Theme Park and Command and Conquer.

To this day I still love computer games. I don't have as much time available to play video games like I once did. However, I do like to set aside some time each week to play.

These are a few of the games that have my attention at the moment.
