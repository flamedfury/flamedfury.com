Building PCs is a fun hobby that I have enjoyed for many years. Below is my best recollection of my PC history.

## Current Rig

I am very happy with this machine; however, it's a pain moving downstairs to the lounge to play on the TV. Looking at building a smaller PC specifically for gaming in the lounge and keeping this one in the study.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600
  
- Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING WIFI II
  
- RAM: Corsair CMW16GX4M2C3200C16 Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: NZXT Kraken Z63 Liquid Cooler 280MM
  
- GPU: # ZOTAC GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Trinity OC 12GB
  
- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe
  
- PSU: Corsair RM1000X 2021
  
- Case: NZXT H510 Flow
  
- Cooling: 2x NZXT Aer RGB 140mm, 1x NZXT Aer RGB 120mm
  

### 2005

This rig is the earliest that I have a record of buying. Everything prior is lost to time. However, those PCs weren't built for gaming. I honestly can't remember how I managed to game on the previous PCs I owned. This rig was the start of my adventures in the World of Warcraft.

- CPU: AMD Athlon 64 3200+
  
- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-K8NS Pro
  
- RAM: 2x 512MB Dual Channel DDR SDRAM
  
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 GDDR
  
- Sound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS
  
- Storage: 80G SATA
  
- Storage: 250G SATA
  
- Case: CoolerMaster Centurion 530 430W w/Side Window Case (Black)
  
- Optical: ASUS DVDRW (Black)
  
- Optical: Gigabyte DVDROM (black)
  
- Monitor: AOC LM925
  

### 2007

At some point during 2007, the motherboard or the GPU died, so I upgraded to an Intel CPU. I don't have the model details; it may have been an E4600 or similar. I also upgraded to my first PCI-E graphics card. Widescreen monitors had become widely available and decently priced, so I got my first widescreen and dual monitor setup. Warcraft never looked better.

- CPU: Intel Celeron Dual-Core
  
- Motherboard: ASUS P5N-E SLI
  
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTS
  
- Sound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS
  
- Storage: 80G SATA
  
- Storage: 250G SATA
  
- Case: CoolerMaster Centurion 530 430W w/Side Window Case (Black)
  
- Optical: ASUS DVDRW (Black)
  
- Optical: Gigabyte DVDROM (black)
  
- Monitor: AOC LM925
  
- Monitor: ViewSonic 22" VX2233WM
  

### 2010

2010 was an exciting time for me. The last rig was on its way out, and it was time to upgrade. I spent weeks researching the latest parts, what would go well together, and, most importantly, picking a kick-ass case.

- CPU: Intel Core i5 750 Lynnfield
  
- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-P55A-UD4
  
- RAM: SuperTalent Performance Series 2x2GB DDR3
  
- Cooler: CoolerMaster Hyper 212
  
- GPU: Sapphire ATI Radeon HD5850 GDDR5 1GB
  
- Storage: Western Digital Caviar Black 500GB SATAII
  
- PSU: Corsair HX650 650W
  
- Case: Cooler Master Storm Scout
  

### 2011

In June 2011, Bitcoin was making news headlines, so a friend and I built a Bitcoin Miner. This was an exciting time.

- CPU: AMD Athlon II X2 255 Processor 3.1GHz
  
- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-990-FXA-UD5 AMD 990FX SB950 AM3+ DDR3 PCI-E
  
- RAM: Corsair VS2GB1333D3 2GB Value Select 1333Mhz CL9
  
- GPU: 3x Sapphire ATI Radeon HD5850 Xtreme 1GB GDDR5
  
- PSU: Seasonic M12D 850W
  
- Storage: Western Digital Caviar Blue 500GB WD5000AAKX
  
- Case: Antec Gaming One Hundred Gaming
  

Within a couple of months, the price of Bitcoin plummeted (not for the first time), so we decided to retire the mining rig. I salvaged two GPUs and built this rig in October to replace the old i5 750.

- Motherboard: Gigabyte G1.Sniper 2 Intel Z68
  
- CPU: Intel Core i5 2500K
  
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LP 2x4GB DDR3-1600
  
- Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100 Extreme
  
- GPU: 2x Sapphire ATI Radeon HD5850 Xtreme 1GB GDDR5
  
- PSU: Corsair AX750
  
- Case: Corsair 650D
  

### 2012

Upgraded the 2011 rig around September 2012 with 2x GTX 670's' and a new Microsoft Sidewinder X4 Keyboard. This would last me for several years.

- CPU: Intel Core i5 2500K
  
- Motherboard: Gigabyte G1.Sniper 2 Intel Z68
  
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LP 2x4GB DDR3-1600
  
- Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100 Extreme
  
- GPU: 2x Gainward GeForce GTX 670 2GB
  
- PSU: Corsair AX750
  
- Case: Corsair 650D
  

### 2016

If I remember correctly, I sold the 670s and got a new GPU, ATI R9 390, to help with the aging rig. It was definitely showing its age.

- CPU: Intel Core i5 2500K
  
- Motherboard: Gigabyte G1.Sniper 2 Intel Z68
  
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LP 2x4GB DDR3-1600
  
- Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100 Extreme
  
- GPU: Gigabyte G1 R9 390 8GB
  
- PSU: Corsair AX750
  
- Case: Corsair 650D
  

In August 2016, the 2011 rig showed its age, and I built a new Intel machine. I thought the 6500 CPU would be fine, but it ultimately became a bottleneck. Moving from the 650D to its smaller 350D counterpart was a great move and saved space on the desk.

- CPU: Intel Skylake Core i5-6500
  
- Motherboard: ASUS B150M Pro Gaming
  
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100i V2 Performance Liquid CPU Cooler
  
- GPU: Gigabyte G1 R9 390 8GB
  
- PSU: Corsair RM650x
  
- Case: Corsair Obsidian Series 350D
  

One month later, I gave up on the R9 390 and put it back in the old rig before selling it and upgrading to a GTX 1070. This card was a beast.

- CPU: Intel Skylake Core i5-6500
  
- Motherboard: ASUS B150M Pro Gaming
  
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: Corsair Hydro Series H100i V2 Performance Liquid CPU Cooler
  
- GPU: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 G1 Gaming
  
- PSU: Corsair RM650x
  
- Case: Corsair Obsidian Series 350D
  

### 2018

I suffered a few years with the 6500 before getting the itch for another new rig. AMD was back in the game with the second generation Ryzen CPUs, and Nvidia had just launched their new 2000 series RTX cards.

In November 2018, I built this beast of a system.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
  
- Motherboard: MSI B450 TOMAHAWK
  
- RAM: Corsair CMW16GX4M2C3200C16 Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: AMD Wraith Prism CPU cooler
  
- GPU: Asus GeForce RTX2080Ti OC 11GB
  
- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe
  
- PSU: Corsair RM650x V2
  
- Case: Fractal Design Meshify C
  
- Cooling: 2x NZXT Aer RGB 140mm, 1x NZXT Aer RGB 120mm
  

### 2019

Around October 2019, the Asus 2080Ti started experiencing some troubles. Overheating and coil whine. After what seemed like months, I managed to get a replacement. Aotearoa's consumer laws are great.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
  
- Motherboard: MSI B450 TOMAHAWK
  
- RAM: Corsair CMW16GX4M2C3200C16 Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: AMD Wraith Prism CPU cooler
  
- GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING OC 11G
  
- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe
  
- PSU: Corsair RM650x V2
  
- Case: Fractal Design Meshify C
  
- Cooling: 2x NZXT Aer RGB 140mm, 1x NZXT Aer RGB 120mm
  

### 2021

The Ryzen RTX rig is still doing the job; however, the Wraith Prism cooler was too noisy. During Aotearoa's second COVID lockdown, I upgraded to a be quiet Dark Rock 4 CPU cooler.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
  
- Motherboard: MSI B450 TOMAHAWK
  
- RAM: Corsair CMW16GX4M2C3200C16 Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: be quiet Dark Rock 4 CPU Cooler
  
- GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING OC 11G
  
- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe
  
- PSU: Corsair RM650x V2
  
- Case: Fractal Design Meshify C
  
- Cooling: 2x NZXT Aer RGB 140mm, 1x NZXT Aer RGB 120mm
  

### 2022

Four years later and the Ryzen rig was definitely showing its age. The CPU was struggling, and the GPU was dying.

In August 2022, I looked at how I might add a few more years of life to this rig. Knowing the new generation CPUs and GPUS were on the horizon, I was looking to make some quick, cheap upgrades.

However, while taking advantage of some great sales, I picked up a new Ryzen 5600 CPU and an RTX 3080Ti (It was such a great price I couldn't pass the opportunity to buy it).

What happened next was crazy. I bricked my motherboard while attempting to flash the BIOS to support the new 5000 series CPU. Then I found out that the 3080Ti was too big for the Meshify C case (seriously, it is double the size of the 2080Ti).

I couldn't bare not having a working PC and quickly picked up a new motherboard, case and CPU cooler.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600
  
- Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING WIFI II
  
- RAM: Corsair CMW16GX4M2C3200C16 Vengeance RGB PRO 16GB (2x 8GB)
  
- Cooler: NZXT Kraken Z63 Liquid Cooler 280MM
  
- GPU: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING OC 11G
  
- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe
  
- PSU: Corsair RM1000X 2021
  
- Case: NZXT H510 Flow
  
- Cooling: 2x NZXT Aer RGB 140mm, 1x NZXT Aer RGB 120mm
