Based on the companion website of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager'. It takes over the core functionality, which is using Tailwind CSS to generate CSS variables based on design tokens.

Just like the original and role model, this starter uses modern CSS, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement, wrapped in a basic template, ideal for personal websites and other small projects.

The aim is to hopefully spread the use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

Edit your preferences (colors, fonts, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/css/design-tokens`.
