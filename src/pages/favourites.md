A list of things that I like. If I have any type of brand loyalty, this will inform you of that. As with most pages on my website, a continual work in progress.

## Brewery
I love local beer, but not afraid to try as many beers as I can wherever I visit.
- [Baylands](https://baylands.beer)
- [Garage Project](https://garageproject.co.nz/)

## Beer
I feel the market is oversaturated with Hazy's. That's why I reach for a WCIPA whenever I can.
- West Coast IPA

## Chocolate
Another local favourite here. Whittaker's gets lots of brand loyalty after the "purple" one destroyed their own reputation here.
- [Whittaker's](https://www.whittakers.co.nz/), I can't resist a [Peanut Slab](https://www.whittakers.co.nz/en_NZ/products/peanut/slab).

## Clothing
I like simple, comfortable clothes.
- [ASColour](https://ascolour.co.nz/)
- [Huffer](https://huffer.co.nz/)
- [Federation](https://federation.co.nz/)
- [LOWER](https://www.lower.co.nz/)

## Cologne
Nice and simple.
- Viktor & Rolf Spice Bomb

## Shoe
An iconic shoe that is both stylish and comfortable.
- [Nike Airfoce 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Air_Force)

## Skate
Support local, always!
- [Empire Skateboards](https://empireskate.co.nz/)
