This is an [interests](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/) page. An interests page is a space to share your passions and experiences; if you don't have one, you should create one, too. It's a great way to connect with others who share your interests and direct surfers to other parts of your website.

I was hesitant to create this page about my interests. Just by reading this website, you should get an idea about my interests. However, as I write this now, an interests page is another entry point for the rest of the website, a wonderful curated experience for you, fellow web surfers. You've made it this far; read on and start exploring other areas of my website.

## The Web

It's no secret, [I Love The Web](/posts/i-love-the-web/). The web is not just a thing to scroll when you're bored. The web is a community, a place of inspiration, and a place to find like-minded individuals like you or me. The web is why most of you have found my humble little website.

I surf and read a lot across the web. Check out my ever-growing list of [bookmarks](/bookmarks/) of posts and articles I've found interesting, mostly related to the web and creating websites.

## Books

Reading, or listening to books, is how I spend much of my alone time. I keep track of all the books I read over on the Bookshelf, and I often share my thoughts and recommendations on the [Bookshelf](/bookshelf/) page and sometimes [write about books](/posts/books/) too.

## Comics

I'm a lifelong comics fan. My love for comics is evident in my [collection](/comics/) and the posts I've [written about them](/posts/comics/). I prioritize reading and collecting X-Men books, but I also read a bunch of other Marvel titles, thanks to Marvel Unlimited. I've started branching out and reading non-Marvel books through one of my local librarie's Hoopla subscriotion.

## Music

[Music](/posts/music/) has always been a big part of my life, and I can spend hours listening to music. The thrill of discovering new bands and artists is something I truly enjoy.

I sometimes pretend I'm a trendy music curator and have tried to maintain [a collection of mixtapes](/mixtapes/); I would like to find a better format for these. Don't forget to check out my vinyl collection over on the [Recordshelf](/recordshelf/).

## Games

I don't consider myself a [gamer](/posts/games); I'm a [World Of Warcraft](/tags/warcraft/) player who occasionally plays other games. But when I do get to game outside of Warcraft, I'm all in for a decent story-driven RPG. The thrill of a good game is something I always look forward to. I've started an attempt at detailing a list of impactful games throughout my life over on the [Gameshelf](/gameshelf/).

## Fitness & Sport

I've been working out most of my adult life, but like many, I had to adapt my routine when COVID-19 hit. I gave up my gym membership and refocused that money on building an adequate gym in my garage. I only wish my garage was bigger to fit in some more gear. I spend my time lifting weights and doing cardio on my spin bike. I love the [Les Mills Cycle classes](https://www.lesmills.com/ondemand/workouts/indoor-cycling/) to keep me fit.

## Beer

All the working out from above? I do all that so that I can enjoy a [beer(s)](/tags/beer/) over the weekend. Until recently, I was an avid home brewer at a special home brew facility in town. Unforunately due to the current economic climate, they had to shut down. Until something similar pops up, I'll continue to support my [local breweries](/favourites/#brewery).
