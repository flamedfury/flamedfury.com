    I've always been into computer games and have played them for as long as I can remember.
    You can read more about that over here,
    <a href="/posts/video-games-and-me/">Video Games And Me</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page showcases what I'm currently playing, games I want to finish, and some favorites from over the years. I drew inspiration from these game pages when building this section.

          Another classic from the CD-ROM era alongside Command & Conquer. Building and managing
          theme parks was endlessly entertaining, with its colorful graphics and quirky British humor.
          The depth of management simulation was incredible for its time.

          One of the first games we got on CD-ROM once we had our own PC at home running
          Windows 95. I don't remember how we found out about C&C. We spent a lot of time at
          an Internet Cafe playing C&C multiplayer (for $20 an hour) but can't remember if
          that came before or after getting the PC at home. Anyway I either spent hours
          playing through the campaign by myself or multiplayer with my brother and friends
          at the Internet Cafe. We didn't have Internet during 1995 but the first thing I
          remember downloading from the Internet at a family friend's house was a `.bat`
          file that allowed me to edit the unit properties. In the end it destroyed the fun
          of playing the game at home. My last memory of this was my save point on the last
          GDI mission that was right before I lost. I never did end up finishing...

        <h4>SimCity 2000 (1993)</h4>
        <p class="game-meta">Maxis • City Building • PC</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          SimCity 2000 was a game I spent many hours playing at other people's houses. Around
          the time of its release we either still had the Commodore 64 and a Sega Master
          System so it wasn't an option to play at home. When we got our first PC at home a
          family friend loaded this and Dune II with a bunch of shareware and demo games and
          I was set. I'd continue playing on and off for years.

      <div>
        <h4>Dune II (1992)</h4>
        <p class="game-meta">Westwood Studios • Real-time Strategy • PC</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Dune II was my introduction to real-time strategy games and the concept of Dune.
          This game set the standard of what RTS games would become and had heavy influences
          on games like Command & Conquer. I spent hours playing this game. The craziest
          thing I remember was having to keep an eye on your spice harvestors as they were
          at risk of being swallowed by the sand worms. Super frustrating losing your last
          harvester to a worm and having to start a mission all over again.
