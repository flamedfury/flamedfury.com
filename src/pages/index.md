## What's going on Internet?

Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd</span>ðŸ”¥, the digital artisan behind <span class="gradient-text">Flamed Fury</span>. Since [1996](/memories/), I've been a keen Web surfer. This homepage is my homage to the net.

My devotion to the Web is unwavering, yet I find myself at odds with certain modern trends. The commercialisation, monetisation, and walled-garden silo approach irk me; I believe [the Web can be so much better](/manifesto/).

Beyond the pixels, my greatest joy is my family, my wife and kids my top priority.

Im into fitness, [music](/recordshelf/), [books](/bookshelf/), [comics](/tags/comics/), [movies](/tags/movies/), [TV](/tags/tv/), [gaming](/tags/gaming/), and [beer](/tags/beer/).

For the technically inclined, this site is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) creation. I used the [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter project by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/), development happens in [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). Witness the magic on [GitHub](https://github.com/flamedfury/flamedfury.com) and watch it unfold on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
