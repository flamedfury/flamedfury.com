You will find my thoughts about the current state of the web, my recollections of my earliest memories of the web, and a bunch of pages detailing some of my interests in records, books, comics, games, movies and tv shows. Come have a read and leave me a message.'

## What's going on Internet?

Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, I'm fLaMEd ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that means everything to me, and probably nothing to you.

I have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. There's always been a time in my life where I have had a homepage in one form or another.

I'm excited to share with you all the new design for Flamed Fury in 2023.
