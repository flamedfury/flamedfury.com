## What's going on Internet?

Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd</span>ðŸ”¥ I'm the webmaster of <span class="gradient-text">Flamed Fury</span>, a collection of stuff that means everything to me and probably nothing to you. 

I've been surfing the web since [1996](/memories/). I've been surfing the web since 1996. I [love the web](/posts/i-love-the-web) and writing [about the web](/tags/web/). 

Outside of the pixels, I'm a husband and father of two. My family and I live with our two dogs in Te Awa Kairangi, Aotearoa.

Once youâ€™ve looked around, donâ€™t hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/)! Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

This homepage is my love letter to the web. Think of it as a throwback to the old everything/nothing websites of the early 2000s.
