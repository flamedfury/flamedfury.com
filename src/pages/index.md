## What's going on Internet?

Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, I'm fLaMEd ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that means everything to me, and probably nothing to you.

I have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. There's always been a time in my life where I have had a homepage in one form or another.

Think of it as a throwback to the old everything/nothing websites of the early 2000s.

I'm excited to share with you all the new design for Flamed Fury in 2023.

## What's new?

- 2023-01-21: Added new website design.
- 2023-01-19: Manifesto page updated.
- 2023-01-17: All pages updated
