Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, I'm [fLaMEd](/about/) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that means everything to to me and probably nothing to you.

I have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. There's always been a time in my life when I have had a homepage in one form or another.

Think of it as a throwback to the old everything/nothing websites of the early 2000s.

### How to browse this website?

I've made browsing Flamed Fury as simple as it can be and divided it into four main sections that you can find in the top navigation. 

The Collections section collects details about my interests and hobbies. I'm into [books](/bookshelf/), [comics](/comics/), [games](/gameshelf/), [music](/recordshelf/), skateboarding and brewing beer.  Make sure to check out the [Mixtapes](/mixtapes/) and [Vinyl Collection](/recordshelf/) pages.

The Writing section collects posts that I've written, essays and guides. My [Web Manifesto](/manifesto/) is an excellent place to start.

The [Explore](/explore/) section is about exploring and surfing the Web. I've taken a look at popular methods of Web discovery from the past, such as [webrings](/explore/webrings/), [buttons](/explore/buttonwall/), [blogrolls](/explore/blogroll/), and plain old [links](/explore/links/). Rather than dump a bunch of hyperlinks on the page, I've taken the time to understand how each of these was used back in the day, why they fell out of popularity and how they are making a comeback. I hope you discover something new and exciting.

The [About](/about/) section covers the standard things about myself and the website. 

Once you've looked around, don't hesitate to head to the [Contact](/contact/) page and get in touch! I'd love to hear from you.
