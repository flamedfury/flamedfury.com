Kia ora ðŸ‘‹, I'm <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd</span>ðŸ”¥, the webmaster of <span class="gradient-text">Flamed Fury</span>. I've been a citizen of the Internet since [1996](/memories/), and this homepage offers a glimpse into my world.

### About Me

I'm passionate about the Web but not all aspects of its current state. I dislike the modern Web's commercialization, monetization, and walled garden silo approach. [Read more about my perspective](/manifesto/).

To stay fit, I lift weights, ride my spin bike, and explore local regional parks. My days are filled with [music](/recordshelf/) and [audiobooks](/bookshelf/) during workouts or dog walks.

I'm an avid reader of [books](/bookshelf/) and [comics](/tags/comics/). When not in the mood for reading, I love relaxing with a [movie](/tags/movies/) or [TV show](/tags/tv/).

Gaming has a special place in my heart, and I enjoy playing [computer games](/tags/gaming/) on my [PC](/computerhistory/) or [Steam Deck](/tags/steam deck/).

As a [beer enthusiast](/tags/beer/), I've tried thousands, settling on a few favorites. Beyond drinking, I regularly enjoy brewing my own.

Family is my greatest joy; my wife and son are my top priorities.

### Tech Stack
