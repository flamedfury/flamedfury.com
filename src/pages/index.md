## What's going on Internet?

Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd</span>ðŸ”¥ I'm the webmaster of <span class="gradient-text">Flamed Fury</span>, a collection of stuff that means everything to to me and probably nothing to you. 

I've been surfing the web since [1996](/memories/). I love the web, however I dislike the modern webâ€™s commercialisation, monetisation, and walled-garden silo approach to things; I believe [the Web can be so much better](/posts/i-love-the-web).

Beyond the pixels, my greatest joy is my family, my wife and kids are my top priority. 

Once youâ€™ve looked around, donâ€™t hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/)! Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

This homepage is my love letter to the web. Think of it as a throwback to the old everything/nothing websites of the early 2000s.
