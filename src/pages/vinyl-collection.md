Below is my record collection. I enjoy collecting this medium. Selecting a record from the collection and listening to it adds so much more than throwing on a selection of songs chosen by an algorithm.

The record collection is displayed by the release date, not when I purchased it. This may change if I can determine collection dates for the older records in the collection.
