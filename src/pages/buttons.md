I recently wrote about 88x31 buttons as "[Relics Of The Web](/posts/relics-of-the-web/)." This page archives and documents the different buttons used to promote Flamed Fury over the years.

Even though these buttons are too small to be functional on modern high-resolution devices, they are still popular with many people in the small and open web community. If you are into them and would like to link to me using one of these buttons, please feel free to do so. Save any of them as "flamedfury.gif" and link back to me using the following code.

```html
<img src="flamedfury.gif" width="88px" height="31px" alt="" title="Visit Flamed Fury Now!">

      My old co-webmaster, Kertiz, created this button and was one of the original two from late 1999 to early 2000. It reflected the site's vibe and the times. co-webmaster, Kertiz.

      This is from the mid-2000s when we shifted the website's tone to be more serious. However, we didn't make it through the web host change. Kertiz also created this version.

      I began working on Flamed Fury again in late 2020 and launched it as my homepage in 2021. I used the 2000 button until I created my own based on the website header graphics.

      <a href="https://scenequeen.neocities.org/">Scene Queen</a> created this for me in 2022, using the header graphic elements from my 2022 design featuring Miley Cyrus.
