Feedback is important and is used to evaluate and improve this website.

If you provide feedback by e-mail, that feedback is sent directly to me {{ meta.author }}. I do not share these messaged with anyone.

If you submit a guestbook entry, it will be published publicly for anyone who views the guestbook to read.

Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site. All relevant response HTTP headers are set for your protection and the Content Security Policy is adjusted to this websites requirements.
