Standard black record, numbered 404 / 1500. Album released July 2019 while I was traveling Europe. The vinyl pre-sale for went on De Rap Winkel website while I was at the Glastonbury music festival 2019, sitting up by the Glastonbury sign looking over the festival. Was great that I was in the correct time zone when a Griselda project went up for sale.
