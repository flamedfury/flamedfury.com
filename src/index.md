Your first stop off of the Information Super Highway!

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [fLaMEd](about) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that I like.

I have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. There's always been a time in my life where I have had a homepage in one form or another.

 This homepage is being constructed in public, it is constantly under construction. I will often push changes to it to try things out. I spend too much time coding and configuring and need to focus on writing the never ending stream of ideas and concepts down.

## Selected writing

* [My Web Manifesto](manifesto): I love the Internet, but not all things about the Internet. On this page I dive deep into the current state of the Internet and explore whether it is heading in an ideal direction.
* [Early Web Memories](memories): This page details my earliet memories of getting online and surfing the web, I remember all of the fun times, and the not so fun times.
