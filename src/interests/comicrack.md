I enjoy reading comic books. I am a big Marvel fan, and the X-Men are my favourite team; it has been since the 90â€™s when I first started getting into them.

I read comics almost exclusively on Marvel Unlimited, but I also enjoy collecting single issues. I have a stack of Uncanny X-Men and X-Factor from the late 80s early 90s that I inherited from an uncle, and I am slowly filling in the gaps. I am currently collecting all X-Men books that are presently being published. House of X / Powers of X, Dawn of X, Swords of X and now Reign of X, and whatever comes next, every single X-Men book. There are a lot.

I have a stack of Fleer Ultra X-Men cards from the 90s and looking to track down the 2018 set. It might be an expensive exercise as I missed the boat when they were released.
