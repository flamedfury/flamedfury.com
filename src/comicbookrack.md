I enjoy reading comic books. I am a big Marvel fan, and the X-Men are my favourite team, has been since the 90â€™s when I first started getting into them.

I read comics almost exclusively on Marvel Unlimited but i also enjoy collecting single issues. I have a stack of Uncanny X-Men and X-Factor from the late 80s early 90s that I inherited from an uncle and I am slowly filling in the gaps. I am currently collecting all X-Men books that are currently being published. house of x / powers of x, dawn of x run swords of x and now reign of x, and then whatever comes after that.. Every single X-Men book that is being published. There are a lot.

I have a stack of Fleer Ultra X-Men cards from the 90s and looking to track down the 2018 set. Might be an expensive exercise as I missed the boat when they were released.
