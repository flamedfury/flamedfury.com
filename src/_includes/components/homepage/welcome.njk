<h2>What's going on Internet?</h2>
  <p>Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd</span>ðŸ”¥ Iâ€™m the webmaster of <span class="gradient-text">fLaMEd fury</span>, a collection of stuff that means everything to me and probably nothing to you.</p>
  <p>Iâ€™ve been surfing the web since <a href="/memories/">1996</a>. I <a href="/posts/i-love-the-web">love the web</a> and writing <a href="/tags/web/">about the web</a>.</p>
  <p>Outside of the pixels, Iâ€™m a husband and father of two. My family and I live with our two dogs in Te Awa Kairangi, Aotearoa.</p>
  <p>Once youâ€™ve looked around, donâ€™t hesitate to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>! Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
  <p>This homepage is my love letter to the web. Think of it as a throwback to the old everything/nothing websites of the early 2000s.</p>
