Come on over, do the twist
Overdo it and have a fit
Love you so much it makes me sick
Beat me out of me
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
Nature is a whore
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Would you believe me when I tell you, you're the queen of my heart?
She said, she'd take me anywhere
Chokin' on the ashes of her enemy
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
