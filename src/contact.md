Kia ora, you've found my contact page. I still haven't created a fancy contact form, so for now, please send me [e-mail](mailto:flamed@flamedfury.com).

### Ways to leave me a message

Sign my [guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com). I can't reply directly to guestbook messages, unless you leave your homepage link and I can sign your guestbook in return. If you want a reply from me, send me an e-mail.

Leave a message on my [Neocities](https://neocities.org/site/flamedfury) profile. If you're a Neocities user, then you can easily follow my homepage and leave me a message.

### Ways to chat with me

You can find me as fLaMEd across a number of community initiatives.

I'm on the [YesterWeb Discord community](https://discord.gg/XeumYztaFU), come drop in, say hi, and join in on the conversation.

How about a forum? I'm hanging out on the [MelonLand Forums](https://forum.melonking.net/).

I can't wait to hear from you :)
