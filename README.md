# Eleventy Excellent

Opiniated but easy to use Eleventy starter, based on the workflow suggested by Andy Bell's [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/).

If you end up using this starter, feel free to send me a link, I'd love to see it!
Also let me know if you miss any features. Currently in planning: automatically generated OpenGraph images (as fallback) and dark mode.

## First steps

- **Important:** edit meta data in `src/_data/meta.js`, it's being used all over the template.
- Search for 'eleventy-excellent.netlify.app'. You'll find an entry in `src/assets/css/global/global-styles.css`. Replace with your own domain.
- Edit your social media in `src/_data/social.js` and `src/_includes/icons`. If you add new icons they must be prefixed with "social-". By default you have rss, mastodon, twitter, ko-fi, linkedin and github. Great resource: https://lucide.dev/
- Not required, but recommended: Delete `github.js` in `src/_data/github.js` and the blog posts, as these serve only as an example.
- Edit your preferences (colors, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/css/design-tokens`.
- Optional: set your (favicon) icons in `src/assets/images/favicon`.

## Logbook

### 22-12-29

- updated Eleventy
- Major: changed CSS for header, not using the sidebar solution anymore. sidebar.css thus deleted. Now the focus for the logo section doesn't expand all the way to the menu anymore.
- Updated some ref values after reading Alvaro Montoro's excellent article [A Theory of Web Relativity](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2022/21/).
- stripped "noreferrer" from external links in markdown (editable in `config/plugins/markdown.js`), because I don't mind the target page of carefully placed links to identify the source of the reference.
- added two more pages to the 'built with' section, yay!
- Thought: Now that actually some websites in production are based on this starter, should I create formal release notes?

### 22-12-20

- Andy now links to his mastodon profile
- Linked blog posts in readme

- added JS and CSS as as first-class citizens in Eleventy, out of the npm scripts.

### 22-12-12

- updated head structure for better performance
- added "built with this" section in readme
- added note for internal links in markdown blog post
- adding page based preload option, making preload of monospaced font in posts default to avoid CLS

## Credits and Thank yous

**Andy Bell**

His CSS methodology "CUBE" makes sense to me. It goes hand in hand with _Every Layout_ (which he co-authors). He has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. Also, I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Heydon Pickering**

I strongly orientate myself on Heydon's approaches and really love his books.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love order and structure. Aleksandr does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his personal site. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from his blog.
