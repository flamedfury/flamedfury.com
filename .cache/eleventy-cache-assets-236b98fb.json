Again.  \n  \nThree terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  \n  \nNow Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.","pageCount":432,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/06/cc4dfc22313bb093e8fbca813b421215.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":27285,"name":"N.

Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell—the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Now, the Superiority—the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life—has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying. Praise for Skyward An Instant New York Times Bestseller A Kirkus Reviews Best Book of the Year \"Startling revelations and stakes-raising implications . . .

From Brandon Sanderson, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Reckoners series, Words of Radiance, and the internationally bestselling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future. Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's--a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none. No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.

R. Martin’s ongoing masterwork, A Song of Ice and Fire. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY LOS ANGELES TIMES AND BUZZFEED These never-before-collected adventures recount an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living consciousness. Before Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne, there was Dunk and Egg. A young, naïve but ultimately courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers above his rivals—in stature if not experience. Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg—whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits. Featuring more than 160 all-new illustrations by Gary Gianni, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a must-have collection that proves chivalry isn’t dead—yet. Praise for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms “Readers who already love Martin and his ability to bring visceral human drama out of any story will be thrilled to find this trilogy brought together and injected with extra life.”—Booklist “The real reason to check out this collection is that it’s simply great storytelling. Martin crafts a living, breathing world in a way few authors can. . . . [Gianni’s illustrations] really bring the events of the novellas to life in beautiful fashion.”—Tech Times “Stirring . . . As Tolkien has his Silmarillion, so [George R. R.] Martin has this trilogy of foundational tales. They succeed on their own, but in addition, they succeed in making fans want more.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “Pure fantasy adventure, with two of the most likable protagonists George R. R. Martin has ever penned.”—Bustle “A must-read for Martin’s legion of fans . . . a rousing prelude to [his] bestselling Song of Ice and Fire saga . . . rich in human drama and the colorful worldbuilding that distinguishes other books in the series.”—Publishers Weekly","descriptionMd":"A century before A GAME OF THRONES, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros…\n\nA KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS compiles the first three official prequel novellas to George R.R. Martin’s ongoing masterwork, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE.\n\nBefore Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne there was Dunk and Egg.\n\nA young, naïve but courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers above his rivals – in stature if not experience. Tagging along with him is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg – whose true identity must be hidden from all he and Dunk encounter: for in reality he is Aegon Targaryen, and one day he will be king. Improbable heroes though they be, great destinies lie ahead for Dunk and Egg; as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits.\n\nA KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS brings together for the first time the first three official prequel novellas to George R.R. Martin’s ongoing masterwork, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory.\n\nFeaturing more than 160 illustrations by Gary Gianni, one of the finest fantasy artists of our time, this beautiful volume will transport readers to the world of the Seven Kingdoms in an age of bygone chivalry.","pageCount":368,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/08/f40cb206bf5b0cfcb983a1cc20773e00.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":15097,"name":"George R.

You are not prepared. Illidan Stormrage is one of the most powerful beings ever to walk the lands of Azeroth. He is also one of the least understood. Behind his legend, beneath his enigmatic mission, lies a brilliant mind whose machinations are comprehended by few—and trusted by even fewer. Illidan’s righteous reign of justice and vengeance has begun. Long ago, the night elf sorcerer Illidan infiltrated the demonic Burning Legion to ward off its invasion of Azeroth. Instead of hailing him as a hero, his own kind branded him the Betrayer, questioning his intentions after he appeared to aid the demon lords. For ten thousand years, he languished in prison—vilified, isolated, but never forgetting his purpose. Now the Legion has returned, and there is only one champion who can truly stand against it. Released from his bonds, Illidan prepares for the final confrontation in the alien realm of Outland, gathering an army of grotesque fel orcs, serpentine naga, cunning blood elves, and twisted demon hunters to his side. He alone knows what deeply hidden motives guide his hand; he alone understands the price that must be paid to defeat the enemies of creation. Yet as before, he is assailed by those who see his schemes as a cynical quest for power, including the night elf Maiev Shadowsong, his former jailor.

Yet as before, he is assailed by those who see his schemes as a cynical quest for power, including the night elf Maiev Shadowsong, his former jailor. Warden Shadowsong and her Watchers have pursued the Betrayer to Outland to exact retribution for his crimes, and she will not rest until Illidan is in her custody . . . or in his grave.  \n  \n  \n*From the Hardcover edition.*","pageCount":336,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZSTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":78686,"name":"William King","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4,"max_score":5,"count":2,"updated":"2022-10-24T17:47:00.497167Z"},{"source":"recs","score":0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2022-10-24T17:46:48.453822Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4,"max_score":5,"count":3745,"updated":"2021-05-21T06:00:51.876761Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZSTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","slug":"illidan-by-william-king-WhvrS","workId":"17143","addedAt":"2016-04-18"},{"id":"EsAog","title":"The Vital Abyss","subtitle":"An Expanse Novella","publishedDate":"2015-10-15","isbn10":"035650431X","isbn13":"9780356504315","description":"The Vital Abyss is a novella that expands the world of James S.

Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.

If, that is, the world survives.  \n  \nEnder's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.  \n  \n  \nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.  \n  \nSource: us.macmillan.com","pageCount":256,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/07/a323de8a5afdf55b9943a299ca9ff884.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780812550702"}],"authors":[{"id":327,"name":"Orson Scott Card","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"recs","score":13,"max_score":null,"count":16,"updated":"2022-11-30T21:16:06.337895Z"},{"source":"gdreads","score":4.3,"max_score":5,"count":1279268,"updated":"2022-11-30T03:59:33.928115Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.3,"max_score":5,"count":1258195,"updated":"2022-07-06T19:13:29.795686Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/07/a323de8a5afdf55b9943a299ca9ff884.jpg","slug":"enders-game-by-orson-scott-card-w1DyV","workId":"36649","addedAt":"2014-12-22"},{"id":"m2X2i","title":"The Abyss Beyond Dreams","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2014-10-09","isbn10":"0230769470","isbn13":"9780230769472","description":"The first volume in the Chronicles of the Fallers, The Abyss Beyond Dreams by Peter F. Hamilton, is an exceptional novel exploring the mystery at the heart of the Commonwealth Universe. Fitting between the events of the Commonwealth Saga and the Void Trilogy, The Abyss Beyond Dreams is the first in an expansive duology, from the master of space opera. To save their civilization he must destroy it . . . When images of a lost civilization are 'dreamed' by a self-proclaimed prophet of the age, Nigel Sheldon, inventor of wormhole technology and creator of the Commonwealth society, is asked to investigate. Especially as the dreams seem to be coming from the Void - a mysterious area of living space monitored and controlled because of its hugely destructive capabilities. With it being the greatest threat to the known universe, Nigel is committed to finding out what really lies within the Void and if there's any truth to the visions they've received. Does human life really exist inside its boundary? But when Nigel crash lands inside the Void, on a planet he didn't even know existed, he finds so much more than he expected. Bienvenido: a world populated by the ancestors of survivors from Commonwealth colony ships that disappeared centuries ago. Since then they've been fighting an increasingly desperate battle against the Fallers, a space-born predator artificially evolved to conquer worlds. Their sole purpose is to commit genocide against every species they encounter. With their powerful telepathic lure - that tempts any who stray across their path to a slow and painful death - they are by far the greatest threat to humanity's continued existence on this planet. But Nigel soon realizes that the Fallers also hold the key to something he'd never hoped to find - the destruction of the Void itself. If only he can survive long enough to work out how to use it . . .","descriptionMd":"***New York Times* bestselling author and science-fiction megastar Peter F. Hamilton makes his triumphant return to the universe of his acclaimed Void Trilogy with the first novel in a brand-new two-part series.**  \n  \nThe year is 3326. Nigel Sheldon, one of the founders of the Commonwealth, receives a visit from the Raiel—self-appointed guardians of the Void, the enigmatic construct at the core of the galaxy that threatens the existence of all that lives. The Raiel convince Nigel to participate in a desperate scheme to infiltrate the Void.  \n  \nOnce inside, Nigel discovers that humans are not the only life-forms to have been sucked into the Void, where the laws of physics are subtly different and mental powers indistinguishable from magic are commonplace. The humans trapped there are afflicted by an alien species of biological mimics—the Fallers—that are intelligent but merciless killers.  \n  \nYet these same aliens may hold the key to destroying the threat of the Void forever—if Nigel can uncover their secrets. As the Fallers’ relentless attacks continue, and the fragile human society splinters into civil war, Nigel must uncover the secrets of the Fallers—before he is killed by the very people he has come to save.","pageCount":null,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=gLNKBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":33686,"name":"Peter F.

A DANCE WITH DRAGONS A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE: BOOK FIVE In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance—beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind. Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys.

Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.

His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun.

Hamilton's Void trilogy, set in the world of the Commonwealth Saga. Time is running out for those determined to prevent millions of followers from the cult of Living Dreams crossing into the Void and triggering an expansion that will destroy everything in its path. Second Dreamer Araminta is on the run but knows that she cannot escape her destiny forever. But when she finally makes her choice it will change her in ways no one could have expected. Meanwhile, Edeard, the subject of the cult's dreams, finds life as challenging and dangerous as ever. He soon realizes that there are consequences for stability. But is the price for peace too high?","descriptionMd":"Exposed as the Second Dreamer, Araminta has become the target of a galaxywide search by government agent Paula Myo and the psychopath known as the Cat, along with others equally determined to prevent-- or facilitate --the pilgrimage of the Living Dream cult into the heart of the Void. An indestructible microuniverse, the Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat. For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy--energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies... from everything that lives.   \n  \nMeanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker -- as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer -- continues to unfold. But now the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies -- and temptations more powerful still.   \n  \nWith time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide whether to release Edeard's final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be.

To succeed, Sylvanas will be forced to reflect on the harrowing path that brought her to the Jailer’s side and to reveal her truest self to her greatest rival. Here, Sylvanas’s complete story is laid bare: the breaking of the Windrunner family and her rise to Ranger- General; her own death at the hands of Arthas and her renewed purpose in founding the Forsaken; the moment she first beheld the Maw and understood the true consequences of what lay beyond the veil of death. But as her moment of victory draws near, Sylvanas Windrunner will make a choice that may ultimately come to define her. A choice that’s hers to make.","pageCount":400,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/06/7368d9c631a9911ec215d22c6818f58a.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":6677,"name":"Christie Golden","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"recs","score":1,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2022-07-27T01:24:54.658382Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/06/7368d9c631a9911ec215d22c6818f58a.jpg","slug":"sylvanas-by-christie-golden-pANhx","workId":"43692","addedAt":"2022-07-27"},{"id":"LiURD","title":"The Stone Sky","subtitle":"The Broken Earth, Book 3, WINNER OF THE HUGO AWARD 2018","publishedDate":"2017-08-15","isbn10":"0356504905","isbn13":"9780356504902","description":"WINNER OF THE HUGO AWARD 2018 WINNER OF THE NEBULA AWARD 2018 WINNER OF THE LOCUS AWARD FOR BEST FANTASY 2018 An Amazon Best Book of the Year The incredible conclusion to the record-breaking triple Hugo award-winning trilogy that began with the The Fifth Season The Moon will soon return.

Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell—the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Now, the Superiority—the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life—has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying. Praise for Skyward An Instant New York Times Bestseller A Kirkus Reviews Best Book of the Year \"Startling revelations and stakes-raising implications . . .

From Brandon Sanderson, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Reckoners series, Words of Radiance, and the internationally bestselling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future. Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's--a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none. No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly.

But these tools can also disrupt our ability to focus on meaningful work and live fully in the present. Must we choose between one or the other? \n\nNewport's answer is no. In *Digital Minimalism,* he outlines a practical philosophy and plan for a mindful, intentional use of technology that maximises its benefits while minimising its drain on our attention, focus and time. Demonstrating how to implement a 30 day digital detox, this book will help you identify which uses of technology are actually helping you reach your goals, and which are holding back. \n\nIf you care about improving your effectiveness but don't want to become a Luddite or a social dropout this book can lead you to increased control over your time, attention, and energy and ultimately, a richer life. Read *Digital Minimalism* and you'll never again mindlessly sacrifice your productivity to clickbait or lose 40 minutes of your evening to your Instagram feed.\n\n**Cal Newport** is a tenured professor of computer science at Georgetown University. He is the author of five books, including *So Good They Can't Ignore You* and the bestselling *Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.* Newport's ideas have been published in top print publications, including the *New York Times*, the *Wall Street Journal*, the *Economist*, the *Financial Times* and the *Guardian,* but as a dedicated digital minimalist, Newport has never had a social media account. \n\n**On Cal Newport's bestselling book** ***Deep Work:***   \n  \n'Cal Newport is a clear voice in a sea of noise, bringing science and passion in equal measure' *-* Seth Godin author of *Purple Cow* \n\n'A compelling case for cultivating intense focus, and offers immediately actionable steps for infusing more of it into our lives' - Adam Grant, author of *Originals*","pageCount":304,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/06/fb612dd94132c266b4457964c555a364.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780525536512"}],"authors":[{"id":321,"name":"Cal Newport","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"recs","score":21,"max_score":null,"count":32,"updated":"2022-11-26T11:26:57.483982Z"},{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":370,"updated":"2022-10-30T20:29:25.986159Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":43544,"updated":"2021-05-23T15:39:44.845650Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://oku.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/covers/2022/06/fb612dd94132c266b4457964c555a364.jpg","slug":"digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport-uXGWJ","workId":"674","addedAt":"2022-08-04"},{"id":"Rum12","title":"Kilo","subtitle":"Life and Death Inside the Secret World of the Cocaine Cartels","publishedDate":"2020-03-26","isbn10":"1473565855","isbn13":"9781473565852","description":"Join the deadly journey of cocaine, from farmer to kingpin.

How did Maori and Pakeha negotiate a meeting place? Would Maori observe the Sabbath? Should Pakeha fear the power of tapu? Whose view of land ownership and control would prevail? How would Maori rangatira and Pakeha leaders establish the rules of political engagement? Around such considerations about how the world would work, Maori and Pakeha in early New Zealand defined a way of being together. This is a book about that meeting time and place, about a process of mutual discovery, contact and encounter — meeting, greeting and seeing — between Maori and Pakeha from 1642 to about 1840. After introducing the brief encounters and misunderstandings between European visitors and Maori before 1814, O'Malley focuses his study on the period between 1814 and 1840 when he argues that both peoples inhabited a 'middle ground' meeting place in which neither could dictate the political, economic or cultural rules of engagement. By looking at economic, religious, political and sexual encounters, O'Malley offers a strikingly different picture to traditional accounts of imperial Pakeha power over a static, resistant Maori society. In this meeting place, O'Malley shows, Maori and Europeans re-evaluated cultural priorities, adapted the customs of the other people that they found useful and sometimes 'went native' as they fell over into the other culture. O'Malley concludes with an analysis of how the middle ground gave way around 1840 to a world in which Pakeha had enough power largely to dictate terms.","descriptionMd":"Here Vincent O'Malley examines the 'meeting place' negotiated by Maori and Pakeha from 1642 to 1840.
